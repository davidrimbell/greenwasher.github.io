        <h2>India&#39;s Electric Vehicle Problem: Lack of Charging Stations Hinders Progress</h2>
        <p>India is facing a problem with electric vehicles (EVs) because there aren&rsquo;t enough places to charge them. The government wants to have 18,000 charging stations in big cities. If these stations use clean energy like solar and wind power, it will help the environment and make the roads less crowded. It will also save money and make cities more connected.</p>
<p>People want products that are good for the environment and they want companies to be honest about their sustainability claims. A survey found that 80% of people trust companies that share data about how sustainable they are. But 69% of people think companies aren&rsquo;t being honest about their goals. Companies need to give clear instructions about how to recycle and get rid of their products.</p>
<p>Envista Holdings Corporation is a dental company that cares about the environment. They released a report showing how they are being sustainable. They have reduced the amount of pollution they make and they have given money to groups that help people with their oral health. They want to keep getting better and they want people to tell them how they can be more sustainable.</p>
<p>The person in charge of the Sustainable Apparel Coalition is leaving. There were problems with the tools they use to be sustainable, so they had someone look at them and give suggestions. The CEO of Exxon Mobil, Darren Woods, says we shouldn&rsquo;t blame oil companies for climate change. He thinks the government should support technologies that reduce pollution instead of just relying on the market.</p>
<p>A study shows that people who work for the fossil fuel and chemical industries have a big influence on the talks about a global plastics treaty. The study says we need better rules about conflicts of interest and we need to think about the whole life cycle of plastics.</p>
<p>In a world where companies lie about being sustainable, it&rsquo;s important for people to ask questions and make sure companies are telling the truth. We should support companies that care about the environment and want to do the right thing. This will make the world better for future generations.</p>
