    <a href="https://green-washer.com/greenwashing/2024-10-07/27-increase-in-businesses-transferring-ownership-to-employees-in-a-year-to-542/">27 % increase in businesses transferring ownership to employees in a year to 542</a>
    <br/> The number of businesses transferring ownership to employees through Employee Ownership Trusts (EOTs) has surged by 27% in the past year, reaching 542, up from 428 the previous year. This significant increase, part of a 2,750% rise in new EOTs over five years, highlights the growing appeal of EOTs as a business exit strategy. Established by the government in 2014, EOTs offer a tax-efficient way for business owners to pass their shares to employees, avoiding income, capital gains tax (CGT), and inheritance tax liabilities.  Mark Turner, a partner at Lubbock Fine, emphasizes the rising popularity of EOTs among entrepreneurs seeking to exit their businesses. The model allows owners to sell their shares to employees via a trust, often at full market value, with future profits financing the transaction. This approach is particularly attractive if changes to the tax system, such as a CGT increase, make private equity buyouts less appealing.  EOTs not only provide a tax-efficient exit but also enable business owners to preserve their company culture and reward long-standing employees. Entrepreneurs concerned about potential cultural shifts following a sale to a private equity firm may find EOT agreements more suitable. Furthermore, from an Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) perspective, EOTs align with the desire to support employees who contributed to the company s success.  In summary, the growing number of EOTs reflects their increasing financial attractiveness for business owners looking to exit their companies while maintaining their culture and rewarding employees. The potential changes to the tax system may further boost the appeal of EOTs as a viable alternative to private equity buyouts. &lt;|end|&gt;

    <a href="https://green-washer.com/greenwashing/2024-10-07/ab-what-might-us-elections-mean-for-renewable-energy/">AB : What Might US Elections Mean For Renewable Energy ? </a>
    <br/> The US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has significantly boosted investment opportunities in renewable energy, with a focus on expanding federal tax credits for qualifying investments in electric vehicles, solar and wind power generation, and utility-scale batteries. Despite potential attempts by Republicans to roll back some of its provisions, a full repeal is deemed unlikely due to the economic case for renewables and the bipartisan support for reducing carbon emissions. The IRA has extended the time frame for tax credits, providing greater visibility for developers and investors, and reducing construction costs for renewable energy projects.  Investment potential lies in updating the aging US power grid, with battery storage assets playing a crucial role in managing electricity distribution and preventing blackouts. Private credit investors could benefit from the combination of tax credits and project-generated cash flow. Public debt opportunities are also present among utilities and companies issuing ESG-labeled bonds.  While a Republican win in the upcoming elections may alter the investment opportunity set and increase uncertainty, the challenge of shoring up an overextended grid is expected to persist, making an outright repeal of the IRA difficult. The law has already created over 150,000 new jobs in Republican districts and has broad regional impacts. Additionally, US companies will still have to comply with mandatory climate disclosure requirements in jurisdictions around the world, even if the SEC climate disclosure rule is repealed.  In conclusion, the case for renewables transcends politics, and the IRA has intensified efforts to build renewable energy projects across the United States. The economic benefits of renewable energy, bipartisan support for reducing carbon emissions, and the need to update the aging power grid make it unlikely that the potential for new leadership in Washington will change the investment landscape in clean energy development. &lt;|end|&gt;

    <br/> The Brahma Mantra for mankind, as articulated by R Gopalakrishnan, emphasizes the crucial role of leaders with humane, compassionate, and no-nonsense thinking in ensuring the prevalence of natural intelligence over artificial intelligence (AI). Gopalakrishnan, despite his initial reservations about speaking at a tech-focused conference, found value in his perspective as a user and business leader. His insights were shaped by discussions with experts like Mo Gawdat and Ali Zubayd, and a deep dive into the subject matter.  Gopalakrishnan highlights the political and social implications of technology, arguing that AI cannot be left solely to tech experts. He stresses the importance of natural intelligence, humanism, and compassion in overseeing technological advancements. He warns against being overwhelmed by the hype surrounding AI and its potential to disrupt human intelligence.  Drawing from historical events, such as Stanislav Petrov s decision to question the authenticity of a false alarm during the Cold War, Gopalakrishnan underscores the significance of human judgment and natural intelligence. He suggests that consciousness, a state rarely explored by most people, holds the key to humanity s survival in the face of AI s advancements.  In conclusion, Gopalakrishnan s Brahma Mantra for mankind calls for a globalization of humanism and compassion, urging leaders to prioritize humane and compassionate thinking in the face of rapid technological progress. He emphasizes the need for a balanced approach, where natural intelligence and human judgment work hand in hand to guide the development and application of AI. &lt;|end|&gt;

    <br/> Experian s Smart Money debit card, marketed as a way to  build credit without the debt,  raises questions about its true value and purpose. While the card itself doesn t offer unique credit-boosting features, it s closely tied to Experian s Boost service, which aims to help individuals with limited or poor credit histories improve their scores. Boost scans debit card transactions for regular bill payments, potentially demonstrating financial responsibility to future lenders. However, the effectiveness of Boost is limited, with only 13 points of average increase in FICO scores for those who see an improvement.  Despite its potential benefits, Boost may not be useful for many of the 15 million users who have enrolled, as they may not experience significant credit score improvements. Moreover, Experian s business model involves selling consumer data to lenders, which can be seen as a trade-off for the free services offered.  In summary, while Experian s Smart Money debit card and Boost service may seem like a solution for building credit without debt, their actual impact on credit scores is limited. Additionally, the company s data-selling practices raise concerns about the true value of the free services provided. Consumers should carefully consider the potential benefits and drawbacks before enrolling in these offerings. &lt;|end|&gt;

    <br/> Family offices worldwide are rapidly investing billions in energy and exploration and production (E&amp;P) companies, particularly in the U.S., to fill the void left by public-facing investors exiting the sector due to anti-carbon mandates. Tailwater Capital, for instance, raised $900 million from six family offices in eight weeks, highlighting the speed and scale of these investments. The interest from family offices, including those in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, is driven by the demand for low-risk, high-yield returns and the belief that hydrocarbons will remain a significant part of the energy mix for the foreseeable future.  Despite the growing interest, family offices are cautious and prefer to invest for the long term with lower risk. They are often more interested in heavy-drilling deals and are willing to follow rather than lead in investment decisions. The investment gap left by the exodus of capital since the late 2010s is significant, and family offices alone are unlikely to fully replace the capital that has left the sector. Public equity remains a large pool of capital to replace, and many domestic family offices are hesitant to engage with the sector.  The need for capital in the E&amp;P sector is still high, with significant investment required to develop primary and secondary basins. The growing demand for natural gas to fuel power generation and U.S. LNG export capacity further underscores the need for investment. While family offices are contributing to the sector, their investments are not yet filling the void left by public-facing investors. The energy transition is expected to take time, and family offices are positioning themselves to capitalize on the long-term demand for hydrocarbons. &lt;|end|&gt;

    <br/> Footasylum, a UK-based omnichannel retailer specializing in footwear and sportswear, is set to accelerate its growth with a Â£35m Revolving Credit Facility from HSBC UK. The funding will support the company s expansion plans across the UK and internationally, as well as its sustainability initiatives.  The funding package includes a Sustainability Improvement Loan (SIL) that ties borrowing costs to Footasylum s sustainability performance, monitored through an EcoVadis ESG rating. The company aims to achieve carbon net zero for scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 and scope 3 by 2040.  Footasylum s expansion plans involve opening new stores in Aberdeen, Warrington, Doncaster, Rotherham, and Wrexham, with the Merry Hill store set to triple in size. These expansions are expected to create over 100 new jobs and support the company s sustainability efforts, such as offsetting carbon emissions and using recycled materials for carrier bags.  The RCF funding will also enable Footasylum to enhance its technology capabilities, particularly its omnichannel retail solution, and support the development of its exclusive brands. Additionally, the funding will help the company grow its influencer marketing strategy.  With over 61 stores nationwide and a social media following of 5.8 million, Footasylum has achieved record-breaking revenues of Â£319.5m for the year to 27 January 2024. The company s profit before tax rose by 112%, driven by strong performances in its Online and Wholesale divisions.

    <br/> The main conclusion from the article is that the controversy over whether a two-year-old beaver named Nibi should remain with her rescuers or be released into the wild has led to the issuance of a permit by the state of Massachusetts, allowing her to stay at Newhouse Wildlife Rescue as an educational animal. The article also highlights various climate and environmental news, including U.S. politics, tree planting, energy, conservation, and deeper dives into topics like Alberta s feral horses and salmon farming in B.C.  The article begins by inviting readers to sign up for Globe Climate, a newsletter focused on climate change, environment, and resources in Canada. The controversy surrounding Nibi, the two-year-old beaver, is introduced, with the governor of Massachusetts stepping in to protect her. The rescuers  desire to keep Nibi with them is supported by her social media popularity and an online petition.  The article then shifts to other news, covering topics like U.S. politics and natural disasters, tree planting, Alberta s oil sands companies, beluga whale conservation, Halifax s climate property tax, and salmon farming in B.C.  In the section on Alberta s feral horses, the article delves into the history of protests against the government-sanctioned cull of these animals, led by Darrell Glover. The article emphasizes the ongoing struggle to protect the horses, which are not legally protected like other wild herds in Canada. The government s argument that the horses are damaging pastureland and contributing to ecological decline is countered by Glover, who points to other animals and campers as the real culprits.  The article concludes with a call to action for readers to sign up for Globe Climate and to share their thoughts on the newsletter. It also provides contact information for readers to send their questions or recommendations.  In summary, the article discusses the controversy surrounding Nibi, the beaver, and her future, while also providing updates on various climate and environmental issues. The main conclusion is that Nibi will remain with her rescuers as an educational animal, thanks to a permit issued by the state

    <br/> The main conclusion from the article is that US alternative investment managers are lagging behind their European counterparts in meeting ESG standards, with Europe leading the way. Despite progress in ESG management processes globally, the US faces challenges due to regulatory pushback and differing investor pressures. The article highlights the bipolar environment and the impact of the war in Ukraine on ESG backlash. Additionally, there is an increase in greenhouse gas emission monitoring and awareness of DEI among private equity managers.  In the first paragraph, the article discusses the overall progress in ESG management processes, with Europe leading the way and the US progressing more slowly. The article cites LGT s ESG report, which shows an increase in private equity managers with robust ESG management processes from 27% in 2014 to 73% today.  The second paragraph focuses on the differences between the US and Europe in terms of ESG commitment. Europe has an 87% rate of managers rated as  excellent  or  good,  while only 16% of US managers achieved this rating. The article attributes these differences to historical reasons, with Europe embracing stakeholder capitalism and the US favoring shareholder capitalism.  The third paragraph delves into the challenges faced by US managers in engaging with ESG topics due to regulatory pushback and differing investor pressures. The article mentions the introduction of anti-ESG bills and resolutions in US states and the pressure from northern European pension plans.  In the fourth paragraph, the article discusses the complex and bipolar environment that makes it difficult for ESG progress. It highlights the reversal of climate commitments by companies and investment firms and the retreat of the UK from key climate goals.  The final paragraph emphasizes the importance of the forthcoming US election and the need for decarbonization. The article also notes the increase in greenhouse gas emission monitoring and the growing awareness of DEI among private equity managers.  In summary, while ESG management processes have improved globally, US alternative investment managers are lagging behind Europe due to regulatory challenges and differing investor pressures.

    <br/> The International Association of Ports and Harbors (IAPH) showcased its new digital Port Readiness Level for Marine Fuels (PRL-MF) self-assessment tool at the Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM15) in Brazil, aligning with the G20 Energy Transition Agenda. Eduardo Kantz, ESG and institutional relations officer of Prumo LogÃ­stica, highlighted the tool s significance in advancing sustainable marine fuel practices.  The PRL-MF self-assessment tool is part of IAPH s efforts to support the G20 Energy Transition Agenda, which aims to promote clean energy and reduce carbon emissions. The tool enables ports to evaluate their readiness in adopting future fuels and sustainable practices, fostering a more environmentally friendly maritime industry.  During the CEM Hubs event, Kantz emphasized the importance of the PRL-MF tool in driving the transition towards cleaner marine fuels. By providing a standardized framework for ports to assess their capabilities, the tool encourages collaboration and knowledge sharing among port authorities. This, in turn, helps to accelerate the adoption of sustainable practices and fuels in the maritime sector.  The introduction of the PRL-MF tool at the CEM15 event demonstrates IAPH s commitment to supporting the G20 Energy Transition Agenda and promoting sustainable development in the maritime industry. As ports around the world strive to reduce their carbon footprint and embrace cleaner energy sources, the PRL-MF tool will play a crucial role in facilitating this transition and ensuring a more sustainable future for the global shipping industry. &lt;|end|&gt;

    <br/> The Fast-track Approvals Bill could potentially revive the controversial Ruataniwha Dam project in Hawke s Bay, despite a previous Supreme Court ruling against it. The Tukituki Water Security Project aims to ensure sufficient water supply and protect rivers in the region, but faces opposition due to environmental concerns. The project, now owned by a private entity, is working on a new business case and seeks private investors rather than public funds. Environmental groups, however, argue that the project would harm native species and exacerbate water pollution and usage. Advocates for the dam believe it would solve many community problems, especially in light of climate change and water scarcity. The bill is expected to be passed into law by the end of the year. &lt;|end|&gt;

    <br/> The main conclusion from the article is that our everyday consumer habits, such as shopping for groceries and coffee, contribute to a larger systemic issue of environmental degradation and unsustainable resource extraction. The author argues that the convenience of instant gratification through credit card transactions masks the environmental and social costs of production. The article highlights the paradox of  green  products and the phenomenon of greenwashing, where businesses market their products as environmentally friendly without addressing the underlying unsustainable practices. It calls for increased awareness and a shift in consumer behavior to truly address the environmental impacts of our consumption patterns.  The article begins by describing the routine of using credit cards for daily purchases, emphasizing the ease and immediacy of obtaining goods. It then delves into the broader implications of this consumer culture, where the constant extraction of natural resources to produce and transport goods is often overlooked. The author points out the unsustainable nature of this system, as it relies on the degradation of land and ecosystems to meet our needs.  The article then explores the concept of  green  products, such as electric vehicles, and the hidden environmental costs associated with their production. It highlights the energy-intensive process of lithium extraction and the negative impacts on water resources, pollution, and habitat loss. The author argues that these  cleaner  options are often misleading, as they fail to address the root causes of environmental degradation.  The article also discusses the issue of greenwashing, where businesses falsely label their products as environmentally friendly to attract consumers. This phenomenon further obscures the true environmental impact of our consumption habits. The author suggests that this false sense of sustainability does not solve the underlying problem of continual resource extraction.  Finally, the article calls for increased awareness and a shift in consumer behavior to address the environmental impacts of our consumption patterns. It emphasizes the need for individuals to critically examine their own consumption habits and consider more sustainable alternatives. The author concludes by urging readers to think about the ways in which they shop and how they can contribute to a more sustainable future.  In summary, the article highlights the uns

    <br/> The main conclusion from the article is that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a rapidly growing industry with significant investment from both private and public sectors. Entrepreneurs have multiple opportunities to capitalize on this trend through various avenues such as supply chain involvement, sustainable business travel software, and consumer products.  The article highlights the increasing demand for SAF as a cleaner alternative to traditional jet fuel, with major airlines and the Biden-Harris administration investing in its development. The goal is to reach 100% SAF usage by 2050, from the current 1%.  One idea for entrepreneurs is to focus on the supply chain of SAF. This can involve becoming a clean energy broker, developing logistics software, or specializing in SAF compliance. By identifying market gaps and optimizing the production and distribution process, businesses can contribute to the growth of the SAF industry.  Another opportunity lies in the realm of sustainable business travel software. With growing concerns about the environmental impact of air travel, entrepreneurs can create platforms that help travelers book more sustainable flights. Partnering with companies that frequently travel and offering incentives like carbon offset credits can tap into a significant market.  Lastly, the article suggests leveraging ESG data to produce consumer products that promote environmental causes. This can include budgeting apps, credit cards, and sustainable travel gear. By educating consumers on the importance of SAF and investing in emerging projects, entrepreneurs can influence the industry and contribute to its growth.  In summary, the article presents various opportunities for entrepreneurs to get involved in the SAF industry. By focusing on the supply chain, sustainable business travel software, and consumer products, businesses can contribute to the growth of this rapidly expanding sector and capitalize on the increasing demand for cleaner aviation fuel. &lt;|end|&gt;

    <br/> Israel s economy is facing significant strain due to the prolonged war, with rising borrowing costs threatening its financial stability. The war in Gaza has already cost Israel around 100 billion shekel ($26.3 billion) in direct funding through August, with the Bank of Israel projecting a potential increase to 250 billion shekel by the end of 2025. This escalation, including Israel s incursion into Lebanon, has led to credit rating downgrades and a near-record high in the cost of insuring Israel s debt against default.  The war s financial impact is evident in the country s worsening sovereign debt metrics, with the debt-to-GDP ratio reaching 67% and the government deficit surging to 8.3% of GDP. Despite the robust domestic market and international investors  familiarity with Israel s credit, there is a growing concern over the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) implications of the war, leading to a narrowed investor base and increased interest in offloading bonds.  The war has also affected foreign investment, with a 29% drop in 2023 and a decline in global funds  ownership of Israeli stocks to its lowest in a decade. The government has responded by pledging $160 million to boost venture capital funding for the tech sector, which accounts for 20% of the economy. However, the war s unpredictable impact on foreign direct investment remains a concern.  The economic pressure from the war has hindered Israel s agriculture and construction sectors, with the latter being a key factor in the 20% plunge in economic growth in the fourth quarter of the previous year. Despite these challenges, Israel has managed to raise funds through international capital markets and its diaspora bond vehicle, targeting a second annual record haul above $2.7 billion.  In summary, Israel s economy is grappling with the financial consequences of the ongoing war, with rising borrowing costs, credit rating downgrades, and a narrowed investor base posing significant challenges. The government s efforts to support local investment and consolid

    <br/> The main conclusion from the article is that the effects of climate change are increasingly evident globally, prompting governments and organizations to commit to net zero emissions by 2050. Achieving these targets requires a comprehensive understanding of carbon footprints, implementation of emissions reduction plans, and transparent tracking of progress. The BSI Net Zero Pathway, which starts with independent carbon footprint verification and includes annual audits, is presented as a credible and comprehensive scheme to guide organizations on their journey to net zero.  The article highlights the urgency of addressing climate change, as evidenced by recent extreme weather events in various parts of the world. In response, governments worldwide have set ambitious targets to limit the worst impacts and reverse environmental damage. The UK government, for instance, has committed to a 78% reduction in emissions by 2035 compared to 1990 levels.  Organizations are encouraged to take action to meet these targets, but the process is complex and challenging. It involves understanding carbon footprint calculations, devising and implementing emissions reduction plans, and avoiding greenwashing. The article emphasizes the importance of credibility, which is built on trust through actions and performance.  Transparency is crucial for both business success and climate action. The BSI Net Zero Barometer Report 2023 reveals that 94% of consumers consider proper verification of environmental claims important, and 73% are willing to spend more with sustainable organizations.  The BSI Net Zero Pathway is presented as a solution to help organizations navigate their net zero journey. It is not a standard but an overarching scheme built on international standards and best practice guidance. The scheme starts with rigorous, independent carbon footprint verification against ISO 14064-1 requirements, ensuring accurate baselines and consideration of all relevant emissions. It also incorporates key principles from the ISO Net Zero Guidelines (IWA 42):2022, and considers planned business growth within emissions reduction plans.  The article concludes by emphasizing that every organization s journey to becoming a certified net zero business will be unique. However, BSI is committed to making the process seamless and providing organizations with a clear answer
