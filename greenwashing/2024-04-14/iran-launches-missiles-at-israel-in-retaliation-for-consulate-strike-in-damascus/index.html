    <p>Iran has launched a rocket attack on Israel in retaliation for an Iranian air strike in Syria, according to the BBC s weekly columnist, Nick Kelly, who has been quoted as the chief of staff at the UN Security Council for the United Nations (UN) on the issue of nuclear weapons and human rights talks in the Middle East.. () The Palestinian militant group Hamas has warned that the conflict between Israel and Iran is increasingly unstable, and there are fears it will be further attacks against Israel, as tensions continue to escalate in Gaza and the West Bank remain unresolved. Here is the full story of what happened in recent weeks - and what will happen if there is an immediate response to Iran. Why is it threatening to destabilise the region and why it is now escalating, writes BBC News Arabic. The BBC looks at what is happening when it comes to military action in this region, but what does it mean for those who have been involved in an attack which has escalated since 11 October, with the first time it has directly killed 16 people in Iran, the US and US officials have told us about their efforts to tackle this crisis. It is not being treated as  a distant prospect  for peace and peace negotiations, in particular with Israel. This is what I describes as an  appalling  attack by the Israeli government and its allies, from the UK to US, Iran and Israel among the two countries.</p>
