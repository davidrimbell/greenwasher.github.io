  <meta name="description" content="Bread Financial, a leading financial services company, has released its 2022 ESG report, showcasing its commitment to advancing its ESG strategy and promoting responsible business practices. The report highlights the company&rsquo;s focus on managing the business responsibly, empowering customers, engaging associates, protecting the planet, and creating possibilities for communities.
In 2022, Bread Financial integrated ESG principles into its business strategy, prioritizing diversity, equity, and inclusion. The company also took steps to support its associates by improving compensation and benefits. Additionally, Bread Financial launched a financial wellness hub and pledged $1 million for financial inclusion programs.
One of the key achievements highlighted in the report is the successful execution of Bread Financial&rsquo;s Climate Action Roadmap. The company has made significant progress in reducing its carbon footprint and is committed to aligning its policies with stakeholder expectations and ESG reporting standards.
While Bread Financial&rsquo;s ESG efforts are commendable, it is essential to remain vigilant against deceptive practices in the corporate world. Greenwashing, a term used to describe misleading or false claims about a company&rsquo;s environmental practices, continues to be a concern.
The Wagner Law Group, a prominent legal firm, recently published a legal opinion letter discussing the inclusion of &ldquo;climate-aligned&rdquo; funds in defined contribution plan investment menus. The letter emphasizes that financial returns should not be subordinated to climate-related factors when considering investment options. However, it does acknowledge the importance of considering climate-related factors that do not compromise financial interests.
On the other hand, AFP has discovered sponsored videos on social media platforms promoting products for ExxonMobil. These videos, along with right-wing and pro-corporate content, raise concerns about the manipulation and dishonesty of corporations. It is crucial for consumers to be aware of these deceptive practices and make informed choices.
The fashion industry has also come under scrutiny for its sustainability practices. A viral TikTok video showing unsold Vans sneakers being cut and thrown away at a Philadelphia store has sparked a debate about corporate sustainability and retail protocols. While Vans has stated that damaging wearable shoes before trashing them is not company policy, critics argue that the industry needs to do more to reduce its carbon footprint and avoid greenwashing.
The rise of ESG has led to an increasing demand for companies to engage in social issues and effect change in wider society. However, there is a need for companies to strike a balance between social activism and focusing on their core mission. Having a stated position on specific social issues is crucial, but it is equally important for companies to prioritize their primary objectives.
Founder and executive chair Andrew Forrest is facing turmoil at his company, which has led to shareholder volatility. In response, Forrest is pushing for zero greenhouse gas emissions in its iron ore operations by 2030 and investing in green hydrogen. However, his absolutist approach to climate change and high turnover of staff suggest a difference of opinion on how to achieve these targets. This reverse greenwashing is as unhelpful as traditional greenwashing.
Lastly, accounting and finance departments are under pressure to create systems that meet new environmental guidelines and monitor environmental impact. Failing to prioritize these efforts can negatively impact a business&rsquo;s brand reputation, investor expectations, and operational efficiency. ESG assessments are now a common requirement from investors, and regulatory compliance is crucial.
In conclusion, while there are commendable efforts being made in the realm of ESG and corporate sustainability, it is essential to remain vigilant against deceptive practices. Greenwashing and other forms of manipulation and dishonesty can undermine the progress being made towards a more sustainable future. Consumers and investors must stay informed and hold companies accountable for their actions.
