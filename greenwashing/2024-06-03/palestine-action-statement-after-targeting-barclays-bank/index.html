    <p>A group of Palestinian militants has called for a further investigation into attacks on Barclays bank in Bolton, the city s police spokesperson has said, following reports of criminal damage and red graffiti over the building in the early hours of the morning, on Monday, June 3, which led to an attack on the Bank of England in Manchester.. (). Протест against the bank has been launched by the group known as Palestine Action, it is calling for the police to stop their actions until the end of June, after they were covered in red paint and painted in front of an entire branch in Bradford, Manchester City Centre, and another bank was targeted with bricks and rubbish on market Street in West Midlands. The group has accused the UK government of defence firm Elbit Systems from selling weapons to Israel and its allies - including the US, UK and European public companies, to ensure humanity is upheld, but says it will continue to act to tackle violence across the country. They say the attack is  incompatible with the blood spill and the destruction of Gaza, as it tries to protect those who believe it was illegally taking part in an anti-Semitism campaign to fight the Israeli armed forces during the fight between the two parties to take action in response to the incident, BBC News looks at the dangers of vandalising buildings in Birmingham and Birmingham, in what is thought to be the first such incident in more than two decades since it began.</p>
