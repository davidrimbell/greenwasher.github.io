  <meta name="description" content="Braskem, a leading petrochemical company, recently reported its 1Q23 results, highlighting its focus on innovation and commitment to sustainability. The company&rsquo;s investments in innovation and technology centers demonstrate its dedication to staying at the forefront of industry advancements. Additionally, Braskem&rsquo;s acquisition of Wise&rsquo;s equity stake will expand its sales with recycled content, further promoting sustainability.
In line with its commitment to reducing emissions, Braskem closed a wind power purchase agreement, demonstrating its efforts to combat climate change. The company recognizes the importance of optimizing operations and implementing financial preservation initiatives to achieve its sustainability goals. By investing in initiatives to combat climate change and plastic waste, Braskem is taking steps towards a more sustainable future.
Consumer expectations regarding sustainability are on the rise, as revealed by recent research conducted by 3BL and TriplePundit. The study found that two-thirds of U.S. adults actively seek and follow sustainability issues. However, there is a gap between consumer expectations and corporate ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) communication. Consumers are looking for companies that align with their values and take action towards sustainability.
To bridge this gap, businesses need to strengthen their ESG communication and build trust with consumers. By syncing messaging with consumer expectations, companies can reduce skepticism and establish long-lasting relationships. The research provides valuable insights for businesses to improve their ESG communication strategies and effectively engage with consumers.
In the business aviation sector, carbon market experts have launched the Carbon Offset Certification (COC) program. This program aims to certify the environmental credentials of products and services, meeting the growing demand for transparency and validating the credibility of environmental claims. The COC program involves third-party assessment to confirm greenhouse gas calculations and voluntary carbon offsets have been carried out according to best practices.
The certification program extends beyond aerospace and is expected to attract interest from business aviation companies. As environmental ratings become increasingly important for financing, the COC program aims to prevent greenwashing claims and provide assurance to stakeholders.
However, not all companies have successfully navigated sustainability-related issues. Target, for example, has faced backlash over its &ldquo;PRIDE&rdquo; collection featuring LGBTQ-friendly clothing for children. The boycott initiated on social media has resulted in a 12% drop in Target&rsquo;s stock value, reflecting the impact of consumer sentiment on the company&rsquo;s market value.
Divert, a Massachusetts-based company, is making strides in addressing the food waste problem in the U.S. The company targets grocery store waste and has seen significant growth in its retail customer base, including major chains like Ahold Delhaize, Albertsons, CVS, Target, and Kroger. Divert operates anaerobic digesters at distribution centers, where unsellable food is collected and processed to produce renewable electricity and heat.
With plans to scale operations to 30 markets in the next eight years, Divert aims to recover 5% of U.S. food waste. The company also leverages technology to help customers reduce waste at the store level. Enbridge has provided $1 billion in funding to support Divert&rsquo;s efforts in building infrastructure for renewable natural gas production.
These recent developments highlight the importance of genuine sustainability efforts and transparent communication. As consumers become more conscious of the environmental impact of their choices, businesses must prioritize sustainability and avoid greenwashing. By aligning with consumer values and taking concrete action, companies can build trust and contribute to a better future for generations to come.
