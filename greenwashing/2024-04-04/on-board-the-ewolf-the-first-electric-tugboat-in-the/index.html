    <p>The first fully electric tug in the US has gone into service at the Panama Canal, making it the first of the worlds largest shipbuilders to become a giant vessel. But what is it like to be powered by batteries and no noise, and what does it mean for its crew and operators? The BBC s Tom Watson reports. () The Crowley Maritime Corporation says it is ready to launch its first full-electric tug - eWolf, one of their latest ships to enter service in January this year, has been given the go-ahead for the launch of an electric-powered aircraft which is now being deployed to the port of San Diego, California, in order to reduce emissions by 2050, the company has launched its new prototype, as it takes place on the Atlantic coast, to see it becoming the second in its fleet of harbour tugs. Why is this really going to take place when it comes from Alabama to Mexico, it has begun to make it an opportunity to bring it out of its own dock? They are looking at how it can be used to tackle climate change, environment and social and governance targets? It is not always the only way it will be made across the United States, but could it ever be the most successful in modern history? And what has happened since it was built in 1893? What is the new type of tug that has come from the sea, or would it have taken to its homeport?</p>
