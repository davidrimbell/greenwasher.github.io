    <p>The world s second biggest bank, BRD Groupe, has signed a significant risk transfer agreement with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), which aims to accelerate the development of sustainable projects in Romania, according to the Romanian Financial Conduct Authority (BRD) chief financial officer, Maria Rousseva, who has been involved in the firm. But  The BBC Newsnight looks at how it is being treated as the first in Europe to take advantage of the investment in climate-related projects, the BBC has learned from its latest talks with two leading international banks. They have agreed to release more capital to finance environmental projects. The scheme is set to be released by the World Bank Group (IMF) to help the Bank of Romania to boost the economic growth of its country in 2015, including the green transition and renewable investment initiatives in this country. But they have reached an unprecedented deal aimed at boosting their efforts to encourage businesses to invest more money in green projects and support female entrepreneurship, as part of an effort to strengthen partnerships between the two banks in an attempt to revive the impact of economic development in its own country, in order to provide savings for sustainability projects across Europe and the world economy, and help those who are among the banks responsible for the project. Here are the details of what it says is about to make it more efficiently using the risk guarantee to support the country within the next two and half years of development.</p>
