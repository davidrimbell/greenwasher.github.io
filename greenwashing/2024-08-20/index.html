  <meta name="description" content="In today&rsquo;s world, people care more about the environment. But some companies try to look &ldquo;green&rdquo; without really being eco-friendly. This trick is called &ldquo;greenwashing.&rdquo; Let&rsquo;s look at how companies do this and why it&rsquo;s a problem.
Companies use different tricks to greenwash. They might use labels like &ldquo;eco-friendly&rdquo; or &ldquo;natural&rdquo; without proof. Some focus on one green thing but ignore their overall harm to the environment. Others spend a lot on ads to make their efforts look bigger than they are. These tricks fool people into thinking the company is responsible.
The oil and gas industry is a big polluter. They might use carbon credits to hide their true impact. The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) now allows these credits for Scope 3 emissions. This worries some people. Former environment minister Catherine McKenna warns that this could let these companies avoid real action. We need strict rules to make sure companies meet their net-zero goals honestly.
A study shows that auditors checking Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reports might go easy on financial reports. This can lead to fake numbers. Auditors and ESG reporters working together can affect financial audits. This could mislead investors about a company&rsquo;s value. Regulators need to ensure fair financial reporting.
To fight greenwashing, Canada changed its Competition Act in June 2024. Now, businesses must prove their green claims with tests and evidence. This makes Canada like other places fighting greenwashing. The Competition Bureau wants public input to make sure businesses back up their green claims.
The insurance industry is in trouble because of natural disasters. Premiums and deductibles are rising fast. Trustworthy AI with human oversight might help. Key challenges include data governance, AI integration, partnerships, digital risks, and adapting life insurance. Using AI and human skill can help insurers handle the market and make positive changes.
Coforge and Salesforce are working together to offer sustainability consulting. Their solution, Coforge ENZO, uses Salesforce&rsquo;s Net Zero Cloud. It helps manage emissions data, automate carbon accounting, and create audit-ready reports. This helps businesses meet their Net Zero goals with good advice and clear insights.
A recent U.S. Supreme Court decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo changed the power balance. Now, courts have more power than federal agencies. This could affect environmental rules and climate policies. The Biden administration promises to protect Americans despite the ruling. This could lead to policy changes in future elections.
Champion Real Estate Investment Trust&rsquo;s Three Garden Road in Hong Kong got the highest Platinum rating in WiredScore certification for offices v3.1. It is Hong Kong&rsquo;s first &ldquo;Quadruple Platinum&rdquo; grade-A office building. Champion REIT shows its commitment to sustainability and innovation with top ratings and events like ESG Week.
People need to know about greenwashing. Awareness helps consumers make smart choices and push for real environmental action. Public opinion shapes how companies behave. When people spot and reject greenwashing, companies must adopt true green practices.
The Volkswagen emissions scandal is a good example. Volkswagen said its diesel engines were low-emission and eco-friendly. But they had software to cheat emissions tests. This scandal caused big financial losses, legal trouble, and a bad reputation. Public anger forced Volkswagen to be more honest about its environmental practices.
H&amp;M also faced criticism for its &ldquo;Conscious&rdquo; collection. The company claimed it used sustainable materials, but investigations showed the benefits were overstated. Public backlash made H&amp;M improve its transparency and sustainability efforts.
Knowing about greenwashing helps people demand honesty. By spotting fake claims, people can support real green businesses. This awareness leads to positive change and a more sustainable future.
