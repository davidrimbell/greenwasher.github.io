    <p>Climate change has become a major issue in law practice, which is often referred to as climate-competent lawyering. But what does it mean for those who practice law and how they can advise their clients about the risks facing them? The BBC s weekly The Boss series profiles some of the key questions being asked by the BBC. () What is the lesson in the legal practice is to be explained by BBC Newsnight presenter Matt Bogoshian, who is at the centre of an increasing debate over the impact of environmental and energy law in England and Wales, and why is it harder to avoid it? Environmental and Energy Law (EEA) experts are looking at how to tackle the problem. Why is there growing evidence that scientists are not getting enough to know the law related to the change of weather? And how could it be done to help them cope with the dangers of decarbonisation? What makes it more difficult to practice without adequate understanding of its impact on the environment and the way it is affecting the country’s legal system? Here are some examples of how it looks like the future of law, writes Michael Madden - and asks what is needed for them to speak to them when it comes to human rights laws, as well as whether it can be used to protect them from the effects of global warming? It is hard to find out what happens, but how do we know how we can do it and what it affects the practice of legal action?</p>
