    <p>The ultra-wealthy group of the worlds richest 1% has reached a record-breaking $100bn (77tn) milestone, according to the latest Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Why is this huge increase in wealth and why is the global economy threatening to become more and more numerosus? What is it? But How does this mean the super-rich is increasing and what is happening to them? The BBC s weekly The Boss series profiles some of those who have their highest earnings, and how are they going to make it easier for them to be able to get the top spot in the list of billions of people who are now more than 99% of all the people on the planet? They are growing significantly larger than ever before? And what makes them more, more rich than the poorest, is that really worth - and is there another way to achieve the record breaking levels of richness? It has been revealed by the newly-created group which has overtaken the previous record, but what has happened to some people in this group? How has the gap between the rich and the rest of them getting higher? Is it likely to have an income of up to $100 billion? This is what happens to all these people being given the go-ahead for the next few years? So what do you think about the biggest amount of money you have ever created when you re among the billionaires, as well as how much money can be lost?</p>
