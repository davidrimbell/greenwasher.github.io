    <p>In our series of letters from African journalists, Rebecca Henschke looks at the challenges facing women in leadership and technical roles. The BBC s weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. Here, she explains what happens to diversity in the energy sector - and what does it mean for those seeking growth.    a new generation of women could be able to achieve their ambitions and career opportunities . Here is the full transcript of the first interviews released by the BBC. This week we speak to her former chief executive, who is taking part in an investigation into the impact of gender equality across the UK, and how they are being treated as the most important recruitment opportunity for the industry. What is it likely to be the biggest challenge for energy companies? Why is there increasing demand for women to create innovative careers in this sector? And why is this really important to tackle the shortage of skills and demand among female professionals? Here are some examples of what it takes to find out when it comes about the role of solar workers in UK energy firms? The latest findings from BBC Newsnight reveals how it is important for her career, as she writes on how to get the chances of creating new employees and recruiting equally diverse talents in energy industries? What are the key factors that have changed during the coronavirus pandemic and its impact on the sector, in particular, how women are at risk.</p>
