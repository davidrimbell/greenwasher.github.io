Boeing got in trouble for not being open about their actions, especially about the environment and society. They didn&rsquo;t check if their suppliers did bad things, which could be greenwashing.
The UK will have a rule against greenwashing in 2024. It wants companies to be clear and give proof to stop lying to customers.
ESMA made rules for funds with green terms to stop greenwashing in finance. They set limits for what funds can invest in to show if they are really green.
People should know about greenwashing to pick real green companies. By knowing the tricks and making companies do right, people can help make the future better.
In short, greenwashing can make people doubt companies. If people believe fake green claims, they might not trust real green efforts. By being smart and informed, people can fight greenwashing and back real green actions for a better future.
