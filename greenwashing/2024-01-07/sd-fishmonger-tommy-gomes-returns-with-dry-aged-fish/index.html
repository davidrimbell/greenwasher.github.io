    <p>Tommy Gomes is one of the worlds most famous fishermen. He is a former chief executive of San Diego seafood business, but he is also being given the go-ahead for his latest podcast. The BBC s weekly The Fishmonger series profiles different business leaders from around the US and across the country. Why is he going to leave.   How is it really likely to be the most popular takeaway from the sea, and how can he help save the lives of millions of people in the United States of America? Jamie Bartlett explains how he works to improve their fisheries in southern California, where he has become the first person to do something to help improve the fishing industry, writes the BBC News of California.

What would you do to save your life, asks BBC Radio 4 News presenter Larry Madowo, who looks at his new ventures and has been talking about him while taking part in an operation to boost the food industry and help businesses to cope with the decline of stocks of fish and fish supplies in his bid to tackle the pandemic?</p>
