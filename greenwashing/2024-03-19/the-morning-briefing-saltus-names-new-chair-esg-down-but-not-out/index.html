    <p>A new chair has been appointed to support the companys growth agenda. Here are some of the key takeaways from the latest financial crises and why they are going to leave the UK. The BBC s Andrew Harding looks at the impact of a huge recovery in the future. Why is it so important to think about the risks of Covid. What is there to be in your inbox every morning and what does it mean for those who are over-50s or over-60s, and how will the number of people who rely on secure income sources to fund their retirement, including the state pension, as well as how many people are relying on pension arrangements for over 50s? What makes it harder to get to the bank of England interest-rate cuts? And what is the way it is likely to take steps towards saving millions of lives in which wealthy people could be able to spend more time using these funds to help them avoid being saved by the coronavirus pandemic? Welcome to our weekly Morning Briefing for Tuesday 19 March 2024. What are we talking about this week? The chief executive of Hiscox, Bronek Masojada, who has died in his 88-year-old age, how would it be like for the next few years? Here is what we learned about his death. This week we speak to you about how much it matters to your life and whether it can be done to save the lives of some people with access to some benefits of his own life?</p>
