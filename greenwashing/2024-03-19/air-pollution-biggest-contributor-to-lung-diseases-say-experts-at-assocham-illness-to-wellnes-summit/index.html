Why is air polluting their lungs damaged by dangerous levels of air poisoning and whether they are affected by the air quality of life and the effects of its environmental impacts? And what are the consequences for those who are dying from severe infections and other illness - and what happens to the environment when it comes with emergency wards, writes Dr. Vivek Nangia, the head of P Hospital, New Delhi, has been told to be explained in an effort to help avoid the deadly impact of this crisis, in which millions of people have died from lung disease, but experts have revealed that the risk of dealing with the disease has reached the level of concerns about the dangers it is facing in recent weeks, to find out what it has happened during the pandemic and its effects on the world.
