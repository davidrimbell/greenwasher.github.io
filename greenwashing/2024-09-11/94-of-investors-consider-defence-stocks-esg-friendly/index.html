    <p> A recent study by HANetf revealed a significant shift in the perception of defense companies among ESG investors, with 94% of wealth managers now considering them as ESG stocks. This change in attitude came after the invasion of Ukraine, which highlighted the importance of defense companies in protecting against hostile nations. Consequently, large banks like Sweden s SEB reversed their bans on defense stocks within a month of the invasion, and most financial institutions have since followed suit.  Despite this shift, defense companies still face challenges in aligning with ESG principles. HANetf s head of research, Tom Bailey, pointed out the difficulties in creating a thematic ETF due to the location of defense companies and their clientele. Investing in defense can be controversial, as there were calls for automatic exclusion of defense companies from certain indices a few years ago.  To address this issue, the Future of Defence UCITS ETF was created, focusing on defense companies domiciled in NATO countries. This approach aims to mitigate geopolitical risks by excluding companies that supply arms to potentially hostile nations. However, this strategy is not without its risks, as it may exclude companies that support Ukraine but also supply arms to the Israel Defense Forces, which has been implicated in war crimes.  Bailey emphasized that traditional ESG screens fail to account for geopolitical exposure/risk, which is a crucial non-financial metric in defense investing. The Future of Defence UCITS ETF has performed well since its launch last year, with a 36.6% increase and $386 million in assets under management.  In conclusion, while defense companies have gained acceptance among ESG investors, they still face challenges in aligning with ESG principles. The Future of Defence UCITS ETF represents a pragmatic approach to mitigating geopolitical risks, but it is essential to consider the potential consequences of regional exclusions.</p>
