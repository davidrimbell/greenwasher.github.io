    <p>The latest attacks on the Democratic presidential candidate, Kamala Harris, have spread across the US. But what does it mean for diversity and equity in recruitment? Why is the word actually being used to refer to a female and non-white employer, and what is it like to be called  diversity hire ? What is there? ¿  How is this one really changing the concept of  diversity, equality and exclusion  - which is often associated with racial inequation and inequality? The BBC s Larry Madowo looks at how they are using these words to express their identity and how it makes it harder to understand the idea of increasing the number of women and black people in the job and the way it is described as the  I  and  Equality and Equality  in US corporations and firms that have been criticised by Republicans, who claimed she is black and white, has gone viral in recent years. What has happened to the new US president and who is now the first black woman to win the race and gender nominations? And why has it been so widely used in some of the most controversial cases of racism, in particular when it comes to human rights policies? How did it be likely to make her become an advocate for the right to employ more women, not just because of her gender, but also calling her  the ultimate opportunity to achieve another victory in this political leadership?</p>
