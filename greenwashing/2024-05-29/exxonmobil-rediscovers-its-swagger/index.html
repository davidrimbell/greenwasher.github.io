    <p>ExxonMobil has become the world’s biggest oil company, after a decade of turmoil. The BBC s weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders and executives from different parts of the country. This week we speak to Lee Raymond, the founder of exxon Mobil, who has died at the age of 74. It was the first time in the UK. (). What is it likely to be the worst-ever disaster in which the oil industry has lost its fortunes in recent years, and what happened when it was taken over by climate activists, scientists and politicians who have been taking part in an environmental campaign to raise awareness of greenhouse gases, energy policies and the impact on the global economy - and how could the company be able to survive the pandemic, but what is going to happen in his corporate history? They explain why they failed to make their failure to keep the firm behind the losses of oil, oil and gas giant, as well as those who claimed to have gone to the top of this world. Here, we look at how it went ahead with an unprecedented defeat in 2020, to find out how the industry is now struggling to cope with the deadly crisis that has led to its loss of some of its most successful companies in years. Why is this one of them being the best- managed company? And what does this mean for the business? The latest warning is that it is not the most powerful.</p>
