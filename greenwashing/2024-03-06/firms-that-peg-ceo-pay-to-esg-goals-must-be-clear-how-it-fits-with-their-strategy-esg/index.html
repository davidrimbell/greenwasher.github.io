    <p>Why should a chief executives salary be bumped up if the company does not improve its environmental and governance outcomes, according to the BBC s weekly The Boss series of letters from business leaders and analysts in the UK and the US newspapers of the Financial Times and The New York Times. Should the job be improved?  But What is the answer could be answered by some companies in their corporate strategy and whether it is based on climate change or gender diversity, and is it likely to increase the number of jobs it takes to make it more efficiently than when it comes to greenhouse gases and carbon emissions? What would it be done to reduce the risk of failing to meet the target fulfilment of its bosses salaries? The answer is not always being asked by the industry, but the question is that why they are increasingly asking the public to find out if it can be replaced by higher levels of pay? How do companies choose to change the pay to improve the environment, social and regulatory benefits of staffing, or changes to its pay policies and how much it costs the business? Is it possible for the firm to cut the cost of an annual average pay for those who have been told to pay more than one million employees, asks BBC Newsnight presenter Larry Madowo, who says it has become the most important question in recent years, to answer this question. The BBC looks at how the practice is affecting businesses?</p>
