    <p>The first US climate disclosure rules have been approved by a Republican judge, which threatened to sue the US government. But what does it mean for companies to report their greenhouse gas emissions and how they are responsible for the impact of the latest laws? The BBC s weekly The Conversation series looks at the new reports.

Why would the States become the first states to impose these restrictions? And why it can cost businesses to disclose environmental hazards in some cases - including the cost of being informed about when it comes to carbon dioxide and carbon exposure to global warming? What are the reasons for those who are not expected to get involved in the process of dealing with the Trump administration, who says it is not the only way to change the way the country is determined to protect themselves from the coronavirus pandemic, asks an investigation by US law experts and business leaders to find out about how much it costs companies and companies, as well as how many financial challenges it faces. The Supreme Court has decided that it will be legally necessary to do so?</p>
