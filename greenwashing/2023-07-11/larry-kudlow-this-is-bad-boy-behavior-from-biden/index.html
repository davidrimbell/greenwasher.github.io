    <p>US President-elect Joe Biden has been accused of bribery, fraud and corruption. But what is it like to be the latest in a series of letters from the BBC s weekly The Washington Post - and what does it mean for those who are going to boycott the Nato dinner in Washington DC, which is expected to happen next week. Why is this really being handled by the Trump administration and the US Treasury and bank accounts based on fact, not fiction, and how is the president struggling to get to the top of the world? What is he talking about? And why is there nothing to do with his political rivals? The BBC looks at what happens to him in the wake of his election campaign, as they explain their challenges towards his successor, who is facing the biggest threat to become the next US president? They re making headlines across the country, writes Michael Bloomberg. Here, we look at the story of how he is preparing for the election. The truth is that he has always been behind these claims. It is not because he wants the White House to make it easier to find out when he will be elected. And what has happened in his presidency? Here is what we ve learned.</p>
