    <p> Neville White, with a rich background in ESG consulting spanning over 27 years and a significant role in asset management, has been appointed as the chair of a newly established board. White s extensive experience includes a 13-year stint as the head of responsible investment policy and research, as well as corporate governance at Edentree. Before joining Edentree, he served as the head of ethical investment for the Church of England National Investment bodies.  White s appointment comes amidst a revision of the 3D investing methodology, as he emphasizes the need for greater accountability in sustainable investment. He acknowledges that sustainable investment has often been criticized for its perceived lack of transparency and objectivity. White s expertise and leadership are expected to address these concerns and enhance the credibility of sustainable investment practices.  In his new role, White will likely play a crucial part in shaping the future of sustainable investment, ensuring that it adheres to rigorous standards and effectively contributes to the broader goals of ESG (environmental, social, and governance) principles. His appointment signals a commitment to improving the transparency and accountability of sustainable investment, which is further reinforced by the introduction of SDR (Sustainable Development Requirements) labels.  Overall, White s appointment as the chair of the newly formed board represents a significant step towards strengthening the sustainable investment landscape. His experience and dedication to ESG principles are expected to drive positive change and foster greater trust in sustainable investment practices.</p>
