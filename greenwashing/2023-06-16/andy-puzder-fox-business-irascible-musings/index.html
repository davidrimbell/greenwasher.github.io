    <p>US President-elect Joe Biden has become the first person in history to win the Democratic Party s nomination for a fourth term in office, the White House has confirmed. Why is he refusing to take part in the election campaign - and why does he want to be the next US president, according to electoral college officials and US media.. But  What is it actually happened to the US economy when it comes to Covid-19 and the coronavirus pandemic, and what is the result of his victory in this election? The BBC has been talking about the results of the polls in which he is expected to get ahead of their primary debate in November, as e explains how he will be elected in 2020 without being guaranteed to make it harder than he hoped? And what would he do for his successor, Donald Trump, who is now the only candidate for the 2020 US presidential election, to find out what it is likely to happen in his first political transition towards the presidency and how they are going to do it to stop the virus and its impact on the country? When he was chosen by the Democrats, it was the last thing he didn t believe it will happen to him? What will he achieve?</p>
