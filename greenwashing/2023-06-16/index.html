  <meta name="description" content="The House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed climate advocacy group Ceres as part of an investigation into potential antitrust violations. The committee is looking into whether Ceres is fostering anticompetitive collusion in the investment industry through its efforts to promote its liberal environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ideology. Ceres had previously assured the committee it would cooperate but failed to fully comply with requests for information. The subpoena calls for Ceres CEO Mindy Lubber to appear before the committee on July 7, 2023. The committee has referred to Ceres&#39; climate cohort, Climate Action 100&#43;, as a &ldquo;cartel&rdquo; that pressures businesses to take action on climate change.
The pending climate disclosure rule introduced by the SEC aims to enhance transparency and consistency in climate-related disclosures by public companies. This rule will require companies to disclose information on greenhouse gas emissions, material climate risks, and any targets or transition plans. The objective is to enable investors to make more informed decisions regarding the financial risks and opportunities associated with climate change. This rule will have implications for Investor Relations Officers (IROs) and corporate secretaries, who will need to adapt to evolving investor expectations, enhance disclosure practices, integrate climate-related topics into investor relations strategies, ensure compliance, and facilitate board oversight.
A class action lawsuit has been filed against Delta Airlines, accusing the company of making false and misleading claims about its carbon neutrality. The lawsuit alleges that Delta Airlines&#39; reliance on the carbon offset market, which is deemed unreliable, renders its environmentally friendly representations inaccurate. This case highlights the importance for companies to ensure their environmental claims are substantiated and to be aware of potential litigation claims. As consumers increasingly base their purchasing decisions on ESG factors, companies should independently verify the accounting of purchased carbon offsets and engage ESG counsel to evaluate the risks of making carbon reduction claims.
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) is conducting a review to understand the impact of new rules on sustainability factors in investment advice and portfolio management services. The review aims to assess the market&rsquo;s evolution and investor reactions since the rule changes took effect in August 2022. ESMA is also interested in gathering data on trends in the retail market for sustainable investment products and services. This review will complement ESMA&rsquo;s efforts to combat greenwashing and will inform any future changes to its rules or guidance in this area. No immediate changes are proposed at this time.
Longwave Financial has earned Green America&rsquo;s Green Business Certification and has been awarded the Green America Certified Business Seal. The firm&rsquo;s commitment to positive social and environmental change is reflected in this recognition. Longwave Financial stands out as a leader in the ESG investing space and is honored to be recognized within a network of other companies dedicated to a sustainable marketplace. The firm&rsquo;s unique approach to ESG portfolio construction focuses on the long-term financial benefits of investing in companies with favorable ESG characteristics and influencing other companies to be more responsible global citizens.
Ashland, a global leader in additives and specialty ingredients, is a key player behind the scenes in the creation of dietary supplements and personal care products. The company prioritizes sustainability and quality, ensuring that its products meet customer requirements. Converting conventional products to organic formats can be challenging, but Ashland&rsquo;s technical and custom formulation services allow them to create organic products that perform just as well as non-organic ones. They have developed unique functional ingredients specifically for organic solutions, addressing the manufacturing and performance requirements of organic products. Ashland&rsquo;s commitment to sustainability and innovation sets them apart in the marketplace.
In conclusion, the fight against greenwashing continues as regulators and consumers demand more transparency and accountability from companies. The House Judiciary Committee&rsquo;s investigation into Ceres and the pending climate disclosure rule introduced by the SEC are examples of efforts to combat deception, misrepresentation, and fraud in green marketing. Companies must ensure that their environmental claims are substantiated and independently verified to avoid accusations of dishonesty and false advertising. As the market for sustainable investment products and services evolves, regulatory bodies like ESMA are reviewing the impact of new rules and gathering data to inform future changes. Meanwhile, companies like Longwave Financial and Ashland are leading the way in promoting sustainability and innovation, setting an example for others to follow. It is crucial for consumers to stay informed and hold companies accountable for their actions to ensure a truly sustainable future.
