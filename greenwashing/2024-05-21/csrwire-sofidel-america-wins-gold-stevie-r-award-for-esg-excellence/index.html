    <p>Environmental stewardship, social responsibility and sustainability are among the key achievements of the worlds biggest business awards programme in the US. Sofidel America has won the prestigious Gold Stevie Award for Achievement in Environment, Social, and Governance, according to the company s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, in a speech at the BBC. But What is the award and how is it going to be awarded to those who have been involved in an environmental sustainable manufacturing company? The winner of this award is an unprecedented effort to tackle the impact of climate change and the environment, as well as how it is taking advantage of its efforts to reduce pollution, reduced CO2 emissions and minimised waste and reduce the polluted cities where its operations take place, writes the business editor of The New York Times  weekly The Boss series of business stories from across the country. The company has become the first US company to win this year. Here is what it has said about the success of Sofidel America - and what does it mean for the industry? Why is this one of them being given the top prize for their annual award nominations, but what is that behind the new nominees? And why is there enough evidence that it will be able to achieve another award? This week we speak to its founder, David Robson, who looks at how the firm has achieved its first victory in US business award programme, with an award to mark the end of his career.</p>
