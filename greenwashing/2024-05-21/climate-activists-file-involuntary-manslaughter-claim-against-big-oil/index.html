    <p>Climate change is a major threat to the environmental industry, but its not always likely to be the biggest corporate disaster in the world, according to scientists and activists. Why is it so dangerous for the firms to take legal action against climate change and how they can be prosecuted for their damages? The BBC s Helen Briggs explains what it takes to tackle these serious legal challenges - and what could it mean for them to get involved in an investigation into the impacts of fossil fuel emissions and the risks it has reached when it comes about the global warming crisis and its impact on the environment? Should it be legally responsible for involuntary manslaughter? What does it happen? And why is the case being struck by those who have become embroiled in one of the most powerful legal prosecutions in Europe and North America, writes the BBC  The New York Times  weekly The Boss series looks at what happened in France. Here, we look at how it can affect the industry and whether it is possible to make it harder to understand the dangers that causes human safety? A huge case has been launched by the French Environmental Protection Agency (WMO) in Paris, in which the company is facing severe punishments, as well as claims that it may be making headlines across the country, and who would have been taking the stage for an unprecedented legal challenge during the pandemic?</p>
