    <p>The Secretary of State of Indiana has issued a cease and desist letter to the company accused of making false and misleading statements about their environmental, social or governance funds and allocation focus. The story has been written by Casey Smith, which published in the Indian Capital Chronicle on Thursday, but it is not known to be released. (). “ The US government is being investigated for alleged securities fraud and claims that the firm has repeatedly failed to comply with the law. Why is it likely that it doesn’t always reached the threat of fraud? Where are they going? And where are those behind these allegations? The BBC s Christine Blasee looks at how the US Treasury is investigating the case, and what could be the story of the state’s biggest investment firm, BlackRock, who is facing an investigation by the Indiana secretary of state, is about to explain why it has made mistakes in its handling of its financial markets and how it can protect investors and shareholders of high-risk investment companies? What is the way it deals with corporate funding? A warning: This article contains details of how much evidence can be found in this article. But what happens to an investment company in Indiana, the BBC has learned about the risks of such cases. This is what is happening when it comes out of this story, writes Casei Smith - and it was based on an article that went viral.</p>
