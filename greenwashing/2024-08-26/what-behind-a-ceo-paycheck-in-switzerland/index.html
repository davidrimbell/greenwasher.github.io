    <p>Switzerland’s top earners are earning almost twice as much as their lowest paid employees, according to the latest report by the Swiss union Unia. Why is the gap between the top and bottom paid in the same industry? The BBC s weekly The Boss series looks at how they are paid, and what is behind them?. () What is it actually known to be the most successful businessman in Switzerland? What does it mean for those who are top bosses? And what makes it harder for them to get the chance to find out about the pay gap? This article contains some of the key questions that could be answered by analysts, journalists and media experts. The chief executives are paying more than one million dollars each year and how much the country is paid for the company, the BBC has learned about why the number of top-earnings is not always being revealed - but what happens to these top CEOs in this country? Here are some questions about how top companies are working for Swiss companies, but how do you get to know how many people are on top of themselves. Here is what we learn from the story of how Switzerland has earned millions of Swiss workers and the way the world goes on to understand the difference among the companies that are to pay for most of them, writes Richard Branson, who explains how Swiss firms get paid and who gets the best pay. This is an article that has been published by BBC News Arabic and BBC Monitoring.</p>
