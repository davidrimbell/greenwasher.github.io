    <p>Germany s economic climate is expected to be a major threat to businesses, but what is the impact on business in the country and how is it affecting the economy? Here are some of the key questions being asked by business leaders in their country, including how they can affect business growth and the future of Europe. Why is this shifting landscape?  () How is Germany changing the way business can be affected by the coronavirus pandemic, and why does this change affect your business and your future fortunes becoming more diverse than any other country - and what could it mean for your country to take advantage of these changes? What is your strategy for getting ahead of Brexit? And how can it impact your company in Germany? How can we take it to the UK and other countries? Is it going to affect you?

How do you think about corporate policies and business developments in German countries which are making it harder?</p>
