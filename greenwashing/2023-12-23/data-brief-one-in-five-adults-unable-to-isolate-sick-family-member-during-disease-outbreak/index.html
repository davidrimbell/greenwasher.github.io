    <p>The ability to isolate a sick family member in the case of an infectious disease outbreak is  moderate  or highly likely to occur within the next year, according to new data published by the United States  health body Heluna Health (H&amp;M) and the National Agency for Disease Control (NHS) in Los Angeles, US officials have said..
