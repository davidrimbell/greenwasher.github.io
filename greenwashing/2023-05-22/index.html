The Associated Press (AP) has been accused of promoting climate change alarmism and pushing a woke environmental agenda in its reporting. It was revealed that AP received an $8 million grant from left-wing nonprofit organizations, including the Rockefeller Foundation and the Walton Family Foundation, to expand its climate coverage. Critics argue that AP&rsquo;s reporting is biased and lacks objectivity, serving as a mouthpiece for its donors. The organization has been accused of using leftist buzzwords and framing climate change as an apocalyptic threat. The funding from these organizations raises concerns about conflicts of interest and the independence of AP&rsquo;s journalism.

Demand for clean energy in supply chains is largely driven by companies&#39; performance on environmental, social, and governance criteria. However, some miners in the Philippines face challenges in accessing renewable power.

ASIC, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, may start scrutinizing popular ETFs that hold stocks deemed unethical by leading investment managers. One such stock is Nvidia Corporation, a favorite of ethical ETFs, but around 45% of its core product, graphic processing units (GPUs), are used for video gaming, which is considered less impactful. Additionally, Nvidia GPUs are used in cryptocurrency mining and AI development, which raises questions about their ESG profile. The article highlights the challenges of defining and implementing ESG criteria in investment strategies and the need for authenticity and accountability in impact investing. It also mentions examples of passive funds with ethical labels that contain questionable investments, emphasizing the rise of greenwashing. ASIC is increasing its enforcement efforts to address greenwashing and ensure funds are true to their labels.
In 2021, 145 country leaders pledged to halt and reverse forest loss by 2030. However, the demand for forest carbon credits has leveled off in 2022 due to uncertainty about the rules and concerns about the quality of credits. The voluntary carbon market, where companies purchase credits to fulfill voluntary commitments, lacks regulations and independent frameworks. To address this, a new guide called the Tropical Forest Credit Integrity Guide has been created to help companies develop a portfolio of high-quality tropical forest carbon credits. Companies can play a crucial role in protecting tropical forests and signaling demand for carbon credits.

In conclusion, these news summaries highlight various aspects of greenwashing, sustainability, and the challenges faced in promoting and implementing environmentally friendly practices.
