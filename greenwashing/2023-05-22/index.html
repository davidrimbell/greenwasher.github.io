The Associated Press (AP) has been accused of promoting climate change alarmism and pushing a woke environmental agenda in its reporting. It was revealed that AP received an $8 million grant from left-wing nonprofit organizations, including the Rockefeller Foundation and the Walton Family Foundation, to expand its climate coverage. Critics argue that AP&rsquo;s reporting is biased and lacks objectivity, serving as a mouthpiece for its donors. The organization has been accused of using leftist buzzwords and framing climate change as an apocalyptic threat. The funding from these organizations raises concerns about conflicts of interest and the independence of AP&rsquo;s journalism.
Indigo Ag, a sustainability partner in the agriculture industry, is helping consumer goods companies measure and reduce their Scope 3 emissions and water use through their agricultural supply chain. Through their Market&#43; Source program, Indigo connects companies to sustainably grown crops within their existing supply chain. They have successfully delivered over 10 million bushels of sustainably grown grains, reducing emissions by over 15,000 metric tons and saving 6.7 billion gallons of water. Indigo has also delivered sustainably grown cotton to brands like The North Face. Their proprietary measurement, reporting, and verification capabilities ensure the environmental benefits of their program.
Mining companies are now being evaluated by their buyers based on the type of energy they use in their operations, according to the Offshore Mining Chamber of the Philippines. Miners are required to disclose their energy sources, and if they are not clean or green, buyers may refuse to do business with them. This emerging norm is driven by the need to combat the global climate emergency. Demand for clean energy in supply chains is largely driven by companies&#39; performance on environmental, social, and governance criteria. However, some miners in the Philippines face challenges in accessing renewable power.

Latham &amp; Watkins recently hosted a panel discussion on greenwashing during London International Disputes Week. The panel discussed key drivers of greenwashing complaints, challenges faced by organizations in defining and explaining their sustainability plans, and global litigation trends. The panel also highlighted the importance of aligning external messaging with corporate practice and evolving regulatory expectations. They discussed the enforcement and regulatory risks associated with greenwashing, including the role of regulators such as the Advertising Standards Authority and the Competition and Market Authority. The panel also noted the growing importance of greenwashing litigation and the complexity of these cases. They concluded by discussing potential future developments in greenwashing litigation, including the role of human rights and the need for consensus on key concepts.
ASIC, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, may start scrutinizing popular ETFs that hold stocks deemed unethical by leading investment managers. One such stock is Nvidia Corporation, a favorite of ethical ETFs, but around 45% of its core product, graphic processing units (GPUs), are used for video gaming, which is considered less impactful. Additionally, Nvidia GPUs are used in cryptocurrency mining and AI development, which raises questions about their ESG profile. The article highlights the challenges of defining and implementing ESG criteria in investment strategies and the need for authenticity and accountability in impact investing. It also mentions examples of passive funds with ethical labels that contain questionable investments, emphasizing the rise of greenwashing. ASIC is increasing its enforcement efforts to address greenwashing and ensure funds are true to their labels.
In 2021, 145 country leaders pledged to halt and reverse forest loss by 2030. However, the demand for forest carbon credits has leveled off in 2022 due to uncertainty about the rules and concerns about the quality of credits. The voluntary carbon market, where companies purchase credits to fulfill voluntary commitments, lacks regulations and independent frameworks. To address this, a new guide called the Tropical Forest Credit Integrity Guide has been created to help companies develop a portfolio of high-quality tropical forest carbon credits. Companies can play a crucial role in protecting tropical forests and signaling demand for carbon credits.
This communication contains forward-looking statements regarding future events, market growth, and the growth of the new energies business. While management believes these statements are reasonable, there is no assurance that future developments will align with expectations. Risks and uncertainties, including the demand for crude oil and natural gas, competition, the COVID-19 pandemic, and political and regulatory conditions, could impact future results. The company also faces risks related to intellectual property, contracts, cybersecurity, and compliance with laws and regulations. Investors are cautioned not to rely solely on these forward-looking statements, as they are subject to change.
In conclusion, these news summaries highlight various aspects of greenwashing, sustainability, and the challenges faced in promoting and implementing environmentally friendly practices. From accusations of biased reporting to initiatives promoting sustainable agriculture and building practices, it is clear that the issue of greenwashing and genuine sustainability efforts is a topic of significant importance. As consumers and investors, it is crucial to stay informed and hold companies accountable for their claims and actions.
