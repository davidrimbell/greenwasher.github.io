    <p>Ethiopia s largest bank has recorded its first ever profits, marking the third consecutive year of financial growth in the country. The bank is expected to increase its operating income for the first time in more than two decades, the BBC has learned. Financial Times looks at the results of the bank’s first annual earnings report. But Про  The BBC News Arabic has released a full assessment of its performance as the Bank of England announced it will raise its pay-up capital to 4.6 billion birr, as it launches its new business strategy in June 2026, and says it has seen its success in making significant progress. But why is it going to be able to boost its profit levels? The latest announcement has been made by the president of Ahadu Bank, who opened its doors to the public for another four years, after it kicked off operations in April, but does not have enough money to pay off when it comes to its business, with revenue slumped to nearly half the minimum thresholds for it to meet the target of five billion Birr (£1.6bn) - which means it is set to expand its value of 6.6 billion birir during the pandemic and is now struggling to cope with the coronavirus crisis? These are the key signs of an estimated recovery in its finances and the impact of it on the national economy, writes The New York Times, BBC Telugu reports from the state of West Africa.</p>
