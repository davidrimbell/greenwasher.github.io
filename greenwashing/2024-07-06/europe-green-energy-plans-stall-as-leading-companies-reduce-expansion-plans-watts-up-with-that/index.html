    <p>Europe’s leading green energy producers are being called into question because of rising costs and shortages of energy supplies, reports the BBC s P Gosselin has revealed. Why is it going to be a crisis in the world of wind and solar power? These are some of the latest headlines from the NoTricks Zone.  But How could Europe become the worst electricity producer in Europe and why are they struggling to reach their ambitious targets for renewable energy and wind power plants in turmoil, and what does it mean for the UK and the US - and how much is the impact on the energy industry? The BBC has been talking to P. Goselin to find out what happened to the country. What is coming out of this week? And what is happening when the global economy is under threat, as experts warn the industry is facing an unprecedented plunge in energy prices and risks of falling prices, how can the power industry cope with climate change? What makes it harder for them to cut expansion plans for new offshore wind energy projects? How can it be scaled back? A few weeks ago, it was the first time that businesses have gone on strike in recent years. But what do Europe have done to stop developing nuclear power projects during the coronavirus pandemic and its challenges? Here is what we learned about the future of Green Energy, but what are we expected to do? Is it possible to make it worse for Europe?</p>
