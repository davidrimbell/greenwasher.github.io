    <p>US Republican presidential candidate Joe DeSantis has become the first US governor to endorse Donald Trumps campaign for the Democratic Party in the US state of Florida, according to the New Hampshire state news agency NBC. Why is he taking a political tightrope around business policy and why does it be likely to be the most successful. But  What is it actually really going to take advantage of the Trump campaign is being treated as an unprecedented disaster for corporate policies, and how is his fight with corporations based on racial and gender-based attitudes and what makes it harder for him to win the White House nomination for US President-elect Joe Biden to defend his anti-Disney stance? The BBC s Tom Desantis looks at his latest battle with Walt Street executives, who have told the BBC that he has been making mistakes in his election campaign, is one of those who claimed he had failed to do so? When he was elected in November, he said he didnt care about the business community, but says he is not the only winner of his campaign. The former Florida Governor has apologised for his support for Disney, saying he made an error.</p>
