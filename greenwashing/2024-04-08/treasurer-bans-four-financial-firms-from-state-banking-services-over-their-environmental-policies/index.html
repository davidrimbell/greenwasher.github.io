    <p>The US state of West Virginia has banned four financial firms from taking part in state banking services because of their environmental policies, the Treasury has confirmed, citing a Freedom of Information request from the states chief executive, Riley Moore, who says he has rejected the decision to remove four companies from its accounts.. But   What is going to be known as the State Treasurer has said it is not being allowed to operate in fossil fuels, oil and natural gas companies, including Citigroup, N.A., HSBC Holdings and Northern Trust among the five companies that have been barred from paying for state bank services over climate change, energy and greenhouse gas laws. Why is it so important to protect funds from US taxpayer dollars and how the US economy is affected by politically motivated and subjective Environmental Protection Act (Environmental Governance) campaigns? These are letters sent to four US companies which have failed to demonstrate that they are not engaged in boycotts of energy companies? The Secretary of State has decided to stop them from joining the business. But why is this really actually making it harder to take advantage of state finances in the country? What does it mean for those who are in charge of US government funding - and what could be the biggest threat to the States of Virginia? A deadline has been reached in order to cut off millions of cash worth of money?</p>
