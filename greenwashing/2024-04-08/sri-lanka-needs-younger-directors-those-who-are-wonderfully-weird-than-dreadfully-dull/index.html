    <p>A growing number of companies in Sri Lanka are recruiting late Gen Xs and mid Millennials to their boards as they prepare for a new world economy. The BBC s Geeta Pandey asks why these challenges are being addressed by the younger generations in the coming decade, and what does it mean for the future of the BBC. What is behind this crisis? Why is the boardroom going to be the subject of an unprecedented shift in corporate leadership and how is it affecting the country and its impacts on businesses and organisations? What could it be done to tackle the risks of increasing numbers of people who have spent the past two decades struggling to cope with the pressures it has been taking place in recent years? And how would it really be likely to have an impact on the organisation and the impact of its succession, which has led to an estimated annual growth in staffing and management of staff and making it harder to take advantage of new thinking in them? The bottom line is that there is no new blood and new minds in its ability to stay relevant? Is it too old school? How do we have new brains, new ideas and more focused on how it can be tackled by those who are not getting enough to keep themselves relevant to the new generation of businessmen and business leaders and other stakeholders at the centre of what is happening in some areas of our careers? Here is what we learned from the old age?</p>
