    <p>The European Parliament has published a consultation paper on the UKs financial sector and its impact on climate change. Here are some of the key changes to the Treasury and the EU. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has said it has adopted its latest regulation round-up for November 2023, which has been announced by the House of Commons.. (). Here is the full list of key developments in November - and what is it likely to be the first time it will be released in October 2023.
