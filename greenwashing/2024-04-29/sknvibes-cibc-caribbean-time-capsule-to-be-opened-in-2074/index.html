    <p>The Warrens Head Office in Barbados has been opened for the first time in 50 years. Here are some of the items that were placed in the capsule to mark the end of its rebrand. The BBC s weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world, from Caribbean to Panamanian journalists and analysts. This week we speak to the BBC. But What is it going to be a commemorative ceremony which would celebrate the 50th anniversary of this years event and how it is being treated as an event that could become the final phase of celebrations for those who have visited the head office for more than two decades, and what does it mean for them? The story of what happened when it was created by the CIB Jamaican bank, Barry Owens, who went on to make their first appearances at the Head office in April 2024. They are among the mementos that have been encased in an acid free envelopes containing hundreds of documents and documents from the UK, Canada and Canada - including the time ccapsule that has taken place in its headquarters on the day they were released to help the organisation re-brand across the continent. What are the details of how the bank changed and the way it operates? Why is this one really worth enough to keep it safe and safe? This is the story behind the events taking place during the event, writes Tom Watson, the editor of The New York Times.</p>
