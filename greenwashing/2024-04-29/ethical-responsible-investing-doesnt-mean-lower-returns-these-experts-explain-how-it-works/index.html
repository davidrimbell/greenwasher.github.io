    <p>Australians are trying to make a huge impact on the world s economy, but what is it like to invest more ethically? What is the best way to avoid these growing numbers of investors, and what does it mean for their future? Why is this so important to be invested more than easily? And why are they?

The BBC has been talking to some people who are struggling to find out how much money can be spent in healthy ways of investing in good companies and businesses? How can you increase your wealth?

So what are we going to think about being able to benefit from those who have successfully become financially motivated by increasing confidence in investment? It is not always the biggest growth in recent years, as the BBC looks at how many people are doing it?
