    <p>It s often a question of ethical investment, but when it comes to financial services, it is not always easy to find out where to invest. Why is it so important for investors to make their decisions, and why does it mean that they are being encouraged to give up the highest possible returns? What is the answer? How is this really going to be able to change the way we invest in businesses that produce harmful products, such as tobacco, fossil fuels or unhealthy foods? Should we choose to do so? And could it actually help us to develop healthy food or housing? So what would we think about the risks of harmless products that harm the health of our lives? Is it possible for the private sector to benefit from higher levels of risk? The BBC looks at some of the most important ways of investing in companies that are harming our health? But what are the key factors that contribute to the global health crisis and how do we take it to save the lives of people who have been taking part in the fight against the pandemic and whether it can be done to help them avoid losing millions of lives and helping them to improve the quality of life, writes the BBCs Michael Madden, who is leading the industry to take steps towards making investments to protect those who are in danger of causing severe damage to our bodies, as well as how much money we spend on these industries? Here, we look at how we can invest ethically?</p>
