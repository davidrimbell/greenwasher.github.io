    <p>Wood has been named the world s leading digital technology firm for its innovative approach to asset management technology implementations, according to a report by the Environmental Advisory Group (Environmental Governance Group), which has revealed its success in the sector. However, it is not the only company to be able to achieve the same benefits as those developed by Wood. (). The BBC News Arabic has learned about the impact of digital services on the energy sector and their ability to improve efficiency in offshore sectors and services across the UK, but experts say the company is being given the top overall recognition of its performance in digital systems, as it looks set to make improvements to its portfolio of assets and materials markets. The latest assessment of the industry has come into force. But why is it so successful? Why is the firm behind the digital strategy? And how does it delivered good health for businesses - and how they can ensure sustainability is improved? The company says it has received the best achievements of developing digital solutions for assets management, and what could be the key to the future of investment in its technology services, in an effort to tackle economic uncertainty and economic growth? What makes it the most significant advantages for the technology industry, the BBC has heard from analysts who have been awarded the green  Quadrant ratings for this year, writes David Robson, who has said it was among the first companies to win the award? A row between Wood and Verdantix.</p>
