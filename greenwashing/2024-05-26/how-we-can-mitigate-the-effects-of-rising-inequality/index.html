    <p>Bangladesh s economy is growing, slowly but steadily, according to the latest figures from the World Bank, the country is facing a severe risk of rising income and wealth inequality. But what are the risks that are being considered by economists and politicians in the past two decades, and what is it likely to be. But ¿ How could Bangladesh achieve sustainable economic growth and social stability in this country? Why is this one of the biggest challenges to our economic development and poverty crisis in recent years? The BBC looks at some of its key questions and questions about the impacts of inequalities in their leadership? What is the dangers it has to take into account? A former IMF chief financial analyst Kaushik Basu has asked the BBC about why he does not want to answer the question, writes BBC Newsnight, in his series of recent letters from African journalists who spoke to his fellow businessman, Kaushika Basou. When he was the first person to write this article, he is considering whether it is possible to increase the number of people who have been taking part in an increasingly unequal society, asks the UN Secretary of State - and how would it be possible for his country to get ahead of this year? Is it going to have to do more to tackle the problem? It is not always the answer to this question when it comes to its economic performance? And is there evidence that it can be described as an unprecedented recovery?</p>
