    <p>Azerbaijan has announced plans to raise money from fossil fuel producers to help developing countries tackle climate change, amid a row over the amount of donations it says will be spent on environmental efforts in the country. However, it has been rejected by activists who claimed it was  greenwashing  by the BBC. But Про  One of the world s largest nuclear powers has said it will not be operational until the end of this year. The announcement has sparked widespread criticism and calls for foreign investors to join the fund to support those who are responsible for the global warming crisis, but it is calling for more money to be invested in renewable gas and coal production to boost their contribution to the UN summit in Paris, Russia, China, Saudi Arabia and Russia to take part in an effort to combat the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions across the Middle East, and is now being given the go-ahead to host the COP29 talks in Baku. But why is it the only country to provide funding for green projects in its bid to address the issue of  climate action  - but could become the first major political event in Europe and the UK? Why is this one of its proposals still not reached agreements, writes BBC News Arabic reports from the Gulf newspaper, The New York Times and BBC World Service looks at how much it wants in supporting the polluters to pay wealthy nations to benefit.</p>
