    <p>When it comes to sustainable funds, it s probably not the first time that investors pulled money from their investments, according to the latest report by a leading financial consultancy - Environmental Advisory Group (Environmental Protection Group--IRGC) report. Why is it likely that it is going to be released?  But () The BBC looks at what it has been reported, and why does it really mean that some of the most significant outflows in the US have been seen since the start of this year, but what could it mean for those who withdrawn from US sustainability funding? What is the answer to this question when it emerges that they are pulling millions of dollars from the fund which would have failed to make it more efficient than conventional schemes, the BBC has learned about the risks of an outbreak of out-of-the-year closures and how the impact is on the future of US investment in environmental protection (environmental spending) remains unlikely to take place in some areas of interest rates, as well as how much money it was invested in, is not always being kept track for the past year and what has happened to its wealthy investor accounts? And what are the reasons for this announcement? The truth is that there is no doubt that this is an increasing number of people having to pull out of it? Is it possible to see it becoming an unprecedented outfall?</p>
