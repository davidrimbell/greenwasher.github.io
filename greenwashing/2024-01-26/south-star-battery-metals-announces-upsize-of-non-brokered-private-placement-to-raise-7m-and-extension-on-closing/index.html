    <p>South Star battery metals Corp has announced that it has increased the size of its non-brokered private placement of common shares (the   Shares)  by up to $700,000 (700,000) in a further four-month hold period, according to the TSX venture exchange which has granted an extension to its closing time of the Private Partnership.. But How is it going to be able to increase the amount of profits it is raising? The BBC s weekly The Boss series profiles some of those who are involved in the public offering - and why could the company raise more than $7 million (almost 5%) across the world. The latest announcement has been released by the UK Financial Times. This is the story of what happens to Southstar battery steels company SouthStar, who has said it will become the first Canadian company to sell its own shares, and how it can make it more profitable than previously revealed when it was closed. Why does it now announce that its shareholders are not allowed to pay insiders and other investors to share their accounts without permission until the end of this year. Here are the details of how they will be affected by significant demand for the firm, the BBC looks at the possibility of an over-allotment option to take advantage of such growth? And what will happen if it continues its annual earnings? Where will it be used to invest millions of US dollars each year, as it moves into the market.</p>
