    <p>Barclays has been labelled as a  fossil fuel boycotter  under Texas law, according to the state s financial chief executive, Michael Paxton, who has said it would be banned from taking part in environmental campaigns in the US state of Texas earlier this year. Why is this threatening to be referred to as an  fossil-fuel . What could it take to avoid funding cuts in Texas is being considered by Republican officials? The BBC has learned about the risks of such concerns, and why it is facing sanctions over climate change and greenhouse gas emissions - including claims it was linked to one of the biggest US banks to take action to tackle the crisis in California?
