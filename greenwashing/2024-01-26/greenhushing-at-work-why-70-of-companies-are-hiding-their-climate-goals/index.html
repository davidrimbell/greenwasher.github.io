    <p>Companies around the world are deliberately hiding their climate targets to comply with new regulations and avoid public scrutiny, according to a new report released by South Pole environmental consultancy and carbon offset developer. The BBC s weekly The Boss series looks at how the practice is affecting the sustainability industry and how it can be tackled by the public.  () How is it really hard to be able to tackle the problem? Why is the industry struggling to do so without being given up on going net-zero, and what does it mean for sustainable companies? What is behind these rules? And why are they trying to stop making headlines about the impact of greenhouse gas emissions and the risk of rising levels of polluted fuels in recent years? The latest report has revealed that many companies are increasingly talking about themselves as  greenhushing  - and it is now widespread in the UK and Canada. But what happens to companies in fashion, consumer goods, tech and tech companies have become more likely to take advantage of new measures that could lead to the global warming threats? It is not always easy for them to communicate with those who have been warning that its harder to talk about them. What makes it possible for companies to make it more efficiently, writes the BBC News of the Greenwashing agency Grist, who says it has been described as one of its most successful examples of what is happening.</p>
