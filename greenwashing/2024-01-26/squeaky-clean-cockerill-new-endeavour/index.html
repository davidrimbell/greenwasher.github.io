    <p>When a former chief executive has been sacked in January, it is probably not the first time that they have been appointed to leave the country. But why do retired employees take non-executive positions? Why do these companies take their own roles in the world of mining, security and security? What is it likely to be. But  () What does it really mean for those who are standing down for the highest levels of offices in South Africa? The BBC s Dickens Olewe looks at how some of the most famous corporate leaders have gone to the top of an investigation into corruption and abuse of power, and what is the biggest threat to stop them from being involved in conflicts - and how do some retirees become embroiled in an unprecedented political crises, or just because of its safety, which could be the answer to some questions about the risks of re-election? And what happens to them during the coronavirus pandemic, asks the BBCs Chris Stoke-on-Trent analyst Ian Cockerill, who says he was among the people who have lost his job in 2020 when he took the job of director of one of South African gold mines, as well as how many of them are now going to take over the number of senior officers whose careers are not always expected to change the way the industry is running out of control? It might be one that makes it harder?</p>
