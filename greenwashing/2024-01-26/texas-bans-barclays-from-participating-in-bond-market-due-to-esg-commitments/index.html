    <p>The US state of Texas has banned Barclays from participating in the state s largest bond market, following a ban on its environmental and governance policies in January, the Attorney General has ruled, citing calls for information about its future sustainability laws. Why is the bank being allowed to participate in Texas because of climate change. ()  The BBC News  Ben Glickman  has been asked to explain why the US bank has failed to respond to questions about the public security threats of carbon emissions, and how it could be treated as  a fossil fuel boycotter  - according to the New York Times newspaper which reported it was blocked from taking part in an investigation into the ban amid claims that it has not responded to demands for further information on Environmental Protection (Environmental Security) concerns. The lawyer has said the company is under review of its plans to stop using their financial services during the pandemic, but says it will not approve any private security issued by the federal government over its policy changes. But another major bank is facing an overhaul of the law. What is behind the decision to ban it from joining the local bond markets while they are planning to buy or underwrite the national security, writes Ben Glickman, who looks at how the country is affected by restrictions and where it is in charge of taxpayers and other public spending rules? When it comes to Texas, there is no new evidence.</p>
