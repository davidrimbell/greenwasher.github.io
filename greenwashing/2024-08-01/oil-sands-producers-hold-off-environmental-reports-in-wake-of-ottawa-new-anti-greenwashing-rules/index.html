    <p>Canada’s largest oil company has rejected a new Competition Act which has banned greenwashing in the country, according to reports released to shareholders in their second quarter financial results, the BBC has learned. Environmental rules have stifled crucial conversations and caused much vexation within the company, and says it is being. ().
