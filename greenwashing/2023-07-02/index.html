  <meta name="title" content="The Growing Demand for Sustainability Talent and the Shortage of Skilled Professionals"/>
  <meta name="description" content="The demand for talent in the field of sustainability and ESG (environmental, social, and corporate governance) is on the rise, but there is a shortage of skilled professionals. Job postings requiring green skills have increased globally, and in India, about 13% of paid job postings require green skills. The shortage of green skills is holding back growth in sustainable development jobs and could hinder the race to reach net zero by 2050. Companies are struggling to find experts in ESG who go beyond compliance and can lead initiatives and create impact. To address this gap, companies are providing in-house training and partnering with experienced firms to develop learning modules. Institutes like IIM Ahmedabad have also launched courses in ESG and sustainability. The demand for talent in this field is expected to continue to grow in the coming years.
Vernon, a city located five miles southeast of Downtown Los Angeles, has survived a near-death experience due to accusations of corruption and environmental issues. The city managed to avoid being dissolved by promising governance reform and increasing its residential population. However, Vernon still faces significant environmental challenges, including hazardous chemical storage and contamination of land. The city has made progress in reforming its governance and increasing transparency, but some believe that fundamental changes have not occurred. Despite this, Vernon remains dedicated to its industrial nature and is slowly transitioning to more environmentally friendly businesses. The city is also planning to expand its residential population to strengthen its electorate and resist corruption.
American companies are facing backlash and criticism from conservatives, causing them to backtrack on progressive initiatives. Bud Light, for example, faced a boycott after partnering with a transgender influencer, resulting in a slump in sales. Other companies, such as Target, have withdrawn certain items marketed for Pride Month due to threats against employees. Shareholder resolutions opposing diversity and ESG criteria have also doubled in the past three years. This backlash is a result of increasing polarization in political life, and young people are now using their consumer power to pressure businesses. However, companies must strike a delicate balance between advocacy and pushing too hard.
Mirae Asset Securities has been awarded a grade A for its sustainable management by local ESG ratings agency Sustinvest, making it the only securities firm to achieve the top ranking. The company has been focusing on sustainability since 2006 and has set medium and long-term goals for ESG criteria. It has also signed a long-term purchase deal for renewable energy credits as part of its efforts to achieve carbon neutrality by 2040. Additionally, Mirae Asset Securities has earned an ISO45001 certification for occupational health and safety and has revised its dividend payout process to improve shareholder benefits.
The growth of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing is slowing down after decades of expansion. ESG has become associated with politically progressive initiatives, but an anti-ESG movement has emerged, with critics accusing ESG managers of &ldquo;greenwashing&rdquo; and arguing that it leads to poorer performance and higher costs. As a result, the growth in ESG mandates has begun to slow. However, completely abandoning values-based investing would be a mistake. Faith-driven investing, such as Muslim Shariah Investing and Christian Faith Driven Investing, offers alternatives for investors to express their values through their investment capital. The faith-driven investing space is currently small but may grow as confidence in ESG frameworks wanes.
California is considering passing two bills that would require large corporations to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions and report their risks from climate change. The first bill would require corporations earning over $1 billion and doing business in California to report their global emissions. The second bill would require companies with revenues exceeding $500 million to detail how climate change poses financial risks to their operations. The goal is to provide a more complete picture of the emissions produced by large companies and how climate change affects their businesses. The bills have faced opposition from business groups who argue that the estimates could be inaccurate and burdensome for companies.
The prevalence of all-male panels, known as manels, at media events in India raises concerns about the lack of gender diversity and inclusivity. Despite advocating for improved environmental, social, and governance (ESG) behavior, media brands continue to exclude women from important conversations. This perpetuates a cycle where influential voices and perspectives are disproportionately represented, hindering progress towards gender equality. Women leaders in India are breaking barriers in all industries, but their representation in media events lags behind. Media brands must take proactive steps to rectify this trend and prioritize the inclusion of women in panels to foster a more diverse and balanced society.

The number of resolutions opposing companies&#39; inclusion of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria has doubled in the past three years.

Conservative organizations are targeting ESG practices. Companies are being forced to be involved in political issues but must find a delicate balance.
Vernon, a small industrial city located near Downtown Los Angeles, has faced accusations of corruption and environmental issues.

The number of resolutions opposing companies&#39; inclusion of ESG criteria, particularly on diversity, has doubled in the past three years. The term &ldquo;ESG&rdquo; has become politicized, leading asset manager BlackRock to stop using it. The National Hockey League decided to no longer wear special jerseys supporting LGBTQ rights. Young people believe they can bring pressure through business.
