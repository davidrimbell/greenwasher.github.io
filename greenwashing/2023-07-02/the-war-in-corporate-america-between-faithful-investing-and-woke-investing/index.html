    <p>Environmental, social and governance is a politically progressive initiative that has taken shape in recent years. But why is it so slowing? The BBC s weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world, including the US, Canada and Canada, and the United States of America. Here are some of the most important topics in the spotlight.  () How is this sustainable investment strategy - and what does it mean for those who are taking advantage of environmental and social growth? What is the biggest threat to the global economy? Why are they struggling to influence their policies? And what is an increasing number of US investors being told about the impact on climate and justice issues which have led to an unprecedented decline in investments and how could it be used to promote aggressive attitudes towards the environment and governments, as well as how many people have become involved in an anti-environmental campaign? Here is what we learned about these entities, who have been criticised for failing to make it more efficiently and more effectively to help them influence the countrys economic landscapes and other industries? This is how the BBC looks at what happened in 2020 when it started?</p>
