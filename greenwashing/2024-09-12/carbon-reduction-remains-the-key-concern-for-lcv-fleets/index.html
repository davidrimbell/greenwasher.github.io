    <p> Northgate s latest customer research reveals that carbon reduction is the primary motivation for Light Commercial Vehicle (LCV) fleets transitioning from diesel and petrol to electric vehicles (EVs), with 62.5% of fleets citing it as their main reason, up from 50% in 2023. Cost reduction, while still a significant driver, has remained relatively stable at 22%, compared to 20% in 2023.  Melanie Creedy, Northgate s EV business development manager, highlights the growing interest in reducing carbon emissions and the diminishing challenges faced by fleets as EVs become more commonplace. She notes that while cost and implementation remain the most common concerns, these issues are decreasing year on year.  Moreover, 22% of fleets indicated that meeting customer requirements was a key factor in their electrification efforts, as Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) considerations become increasingly important in tendering processes. The pressure to electrify has also decreased, with only 9% of fleets feeling pressured to move away from diesel, down from 20% previously.  Overall, 63% of fleets are just starting their electrification journey, slightly higher than the previous year s 60%. However, 21.2% of fleets are already well on their way to achieving zero emissions. Despite the growing interest in carbon reduction, concerns about cost and implementation persist, with 36.3% of fleets citing cost as a major concern and 33.3% identifying implementation as their biggest challenge. Charging and vehicle choice were also raised as concerns by 15% of respondents, but worries about charging infrastructure have decreased by 4% from 2023 to 2024, and implementation concerns have dropped by 10%.  In summary, carbon reduction is the main driver for LCV fleets transitioning to EVs, with cost and implementation remaining significant concerns. However, the pressure to electrify has decreased, and more fleets are making progress towards achieving zero emissions. Northgate s ongoing EV Roadshows are helping fleets</p>
