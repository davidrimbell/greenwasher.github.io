    <p> TIME, in collaboration with Statista, has released its second annual ranking of the World s Best Companies. The study, which involved a comprehensive analysis of 1,000 companies, focused on three key dimensions: Employee Satisfaction, Revenue Growth, and Sustainability Transparency (ESG).  Employee Satisfaction was assessed through surveys conducted in over 50 countries, with data collected from approximately 170,000 participants. The evaluation considered factors such as employer image, working conditions, salary, and equality, as well as direct and indirect recommendations from verified employees.  Revenue Growth was measured using data from Statista s revenue database and targeted research. Companies had to generate a minimum revenue of US $100 million in the last available fiscal year and demonstrate positive growth from 2021 to 2023. Both relative and absolute growth were taken into account.  Sustainability Transparency was evaluated based on ESG data and standardized KPIs from Statista s ESG Database. The environmental evaluation included carbon emissions intensity and reduction rate, as well as the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) rating. The social dimension assessed the share of women on the board of directors and the existence of a human rights policy. The governance dimension evaluated the presence of a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) report adhering to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines and a compliance or anti-corruption guideline.  The data collected and evaluated were consolidated and weighted within a scoring model. The scores of all three dimensions were added on an equal percentage basis to form the final ranking score, with a maximum of 100 points. The 1,000 companies with the highest score were recognized as the World s Best Companies 2024 by TIME and Statista.  For more information, the full list of the World s Best Companies 2024 can be found on the TIME website.</p>
