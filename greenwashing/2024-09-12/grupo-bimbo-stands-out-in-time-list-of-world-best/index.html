    <p> Grupo Bimbo, a leading global bakery company, has secured its spot for the second consecutive year in the  World s Best Companies  list published by Time magazine and Statista. The Mexican company has earned recognition for its top 10 ranking in the global food category and its 127th place out of 1,000 in the overall ranking. The selection process for this prestigious list is based on three main dimensions: employee satisfaction, revenue growth, and sustainability (ESG).  To evaluate employee satisfaction, surveys were conducted in over 50 countries, with data collected from approximately 170,000 participants. Companies were assessed based on direct and indirect recommendations, as well as employer ratings of verified employees for image, environment, working conditions, salary, and equality.  Revenue growth was another crucial factor in the ranking process. Companies with revenues of at least $100 million in 2023 and positive revenue growth between 2021 and 2023 were considered.  Sustainability (ESG) was assessed based on standardized KPIs from the Statista ESG database and specific data research.  Grupo Bimbo s inclusion in this list reinforces its reputation as a company with exceptional performance on a global scale. The company operates in various industries, including retail, manufacturing, engineering, automotive, and services.  Grupo Bimbo, with its 227 bakeries and plants and more than 1,500 sales centers, has a significant presence in 35 countries throughout the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Africa. Its main product lines include sliced bread, buns &amp; rolls, pastries, cakes, cookies, toast bread, English muffins, bagels, tortillas &amp; flatbreads, and salty snacks. The company boasts one of the largest direct distribution networks in the world, with more than 58,000 routes and over 152,000 associates. Its shares trade on the Mexican Stock Exchange (BMV) under the ticker symbol BIMBO, and in the over-the-counter market</p>
