In her current role at Rolls Royce, Rachael is instrumental in aiding the company s group transformation. She is also concentrating on the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in enhancing supply chain resilience, energy transition, and sustainability. As she continues her journey, Rachael is pursuing her Executive MBA at Warwick Business School.
