    <p>I had no idea what to say or do, says South African scientist Debra Roberts, a leading climate change negotiator for the South Africa government, in her first day as an international conference centre in Panama City. It wasnt just the first time I had to do it. I didn t know what she was doing, she tells the BBC.  (At the beginning of my first meeting in Durban last year, I would be going to become the world s first woman to meet the global warming crisis when I was appointed to chair the UNs Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) talks with the United Nations. But I ve never heard anything about making mistakes and learnt quickly. It was the most important skills for success, and she has never been knocked down by another woman, but she did not know why she is coming to work to tackle the problem. Why is it so important? And what does she do for me? When I came to the top of the list of those who have failed to get over the wall - and could she be the only woman in the country to win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2015, she had nothing to think about her work, writes Jonathan Davies, who has always told us how she worked to fight the change of weather. She spoke to her fellow academics, we have been working towards changing the environment. And I think it was not the best way to achieve it because of her success.</p>
