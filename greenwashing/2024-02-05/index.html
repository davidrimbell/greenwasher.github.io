  <meta name="description" content="Companies often use deceptive tactics to misrepresent their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices, which is known as greenwashing. This article will explain greenwashing and the changing sustainability landscape. It will provide information to help people understand, identify, and avoid deceptive sustainability claims.
One way that companies greenwash is by reporting on their ESG performance, such as emissions data. However, it is important to question these reports and make sure they are supported by credible evidence. For example, the corrugated packaging industry conducted a study to measure the environmental impact of corrugated boxes. The study showed a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions since 2006, thanks to energy improvements, recycling, sustainable forest management, and a commitment to improvement. This shows a real dedication to sustainability.
Another tactic used by companies is to position themselves as leaders in the ESG field. However, not all companies claiming to be leaders are truly living up to their claims. A report by Morningstar found that only 8% of the 97 global asset managers surveyed can be considered ESG leaders. These firms have integrated sustainability goals with financial returns and have a history of sustainable investing. It is important for consumers and investors to question these claims and look for evidence of consistent ESG integration and alignment with ESG principles.
Companies that prioritize social responsibilities are also recognized for their efforts. For example, Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS), a pharmaceutical and biotech company, has been acknowledged as one of America&rsquo;s Most JUST Companies. BMS ranked in the top 10 of its sector, showing its commitment to social responsibilities like employees, customers, communities, and the environment. It is important for consumers to support companies that prioritize social responsibilities and hold them accountable for their actions.
The language and belief system around ESG have changed in recent years. The term &ldquo;ESG&rdquo; now has a negative image, so executives avoid using it due to politics. However, the belief system behind ESG still exists. It is important to recognize this change in language and look for evidence of a genuine commitment to sustainability, even if companies don&rsquo;t explicitly use the term &ldquo;ESG.&rdquo;
Consulting firms play a vital role in navigating the changing sustainability landscape. Firms like SLR, a leading ESG and sustainability consulting firm, are recognized for their expertise in areas like climate resilience, net zero, and circularity. Working with consulting partners like SLR can provide helpful guidance and ensure that companies are taking meaningful steps towards sustainability.
In conclusion, greenwashing and sustainability are evolving. While companies may use deceptive tactics, consumers and investors can use strategies to identify and avoid greenwashing. It is important to question claims of ESG performance, look for evidence of consistent integration and alignment with ESG principles, support companies that prioritize social responsibilities, and seek guidance from reputable consulting firms. By staying vigilant and holding companies accountable, consumers and investors can contribute to a greener and more sustainable future.
