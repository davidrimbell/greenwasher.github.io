    <p>The US state of Texas has filed a law banning state entities from divesting from fossil fuels, accusing it of violating laws designed to protect businesses from the climate crisis and threaten economic damage to the state s environmental and social governance industry, according to lawyers in the US newspaper The New York Times.. () How is Texas allowed to take steps to stop it enforcing the law, it has been announced by the federal judge in Austin, Texas, in which it is accused of illegal investments in oil and gas companies that have cut ties with the industry. The law is being rejected by Republican officials, but could be banned from pursuing an anti-environmental law that restricts state investment in firms that deem antagonistic to carbon emissions and infringing their ability to invest in state companies, writes the Washington Post. Environmental activists have claimed that the Trump administration is facing legal action against the States, and they are calling it unconstitutional and denied claims that it violates US law - but it will not be enforced by federal lawmakers, as the Senate passed the bill in 2021. Here is the full transcript of the legal battle between the two states, who appeared to be the first state to impose sanctions on those who defeated the government amid the coronavirus pandemic and its impact on the oil industry and other industries across the country, the BBC has learned. But why?</p>
