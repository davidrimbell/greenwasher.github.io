  <meta name="description" content="In today&rsquo;s world, many companies talk about being good for the environment, society, and governance (ESG). But some are not honest and pretend to be eco-friendly. This is called greenwashing. Let&rsquo;s look at recent news about ESG investments, company rules, and the fight against greenwashing.
The iShares MSCI USA ESG Select ETF (SUSA) recently reached a 52-week high, trading at $118.03. Managed by BlackRock, SUSA tracks U.S. companies with high ESG scores. Big investors like PNC Financial and M&amp;T Bank are interested in it. Other funds like Vanguard ESG International Stock ETF (VSGX) and iShares ESG Advanced MSCI EAFE ETF are also getting more investments. This shows that people want to invest in ESG-focused funds. But, are these funds really helping the planet, or are they just pretending?
In Bangladesh, recent corruption scandals have shown problems with company rules and auditing. The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) is not effective, and low audit fees lead to poor-quality audits. This needs to change. Better rules are needed to make companies more transparent and accountable. This way, companies can&rsquo;t pretend to follow ESG principles while being dishonest.
San Francisco State University has stopped investing in companies like Lockheed Martin and Palantir Technologies due to pressure from pro-Palestinian activists. This move aligns the university’s investments with human rights standards, showing a commitment to values and social responsibility. However, it also raises the question: are they doing this for good reasons or just for public relations?
The Stock Exchange of Thailand&rsquo;s SET Social Impact GYM project aims to improve the business skills of social entrepreneurs and work with the private sector. While it has helped many social enterprises, the challenge is to ensure these efforts lead to real, measurable social outcomes and not just become another example of corporate dishonesty.
The American Sustainable Business Coalition is suing Texas over Senate Bill 13. The law restricts state investments in companies that boycott the fossil fuel industry. This has sparked controversy. This legal battle shows the conflict between state policies and corporate ESG commitments.
Legend Holdings Corporation reported a 16% increase in revenue, driven by technological innovation and green initiatives. With subsidiaries achieving high ESG ratings, the company aims to continue its growth through scientific innovation and social responsibility. But the challenge remains to distinguish between real ESG efforts and fake ones, where companies may exaggerate their green credentials to attract investors.
As ESG investments and company rules gain momentum, the threat of greenwashing persists. Investors, regulators, and consumers must remain alert, scrutinizing claims and demanding transparency. Only through collective effort can we unmask deception and ensure that ESG principles lead to genuine, positive change for our planet and future generations.
Public perception plays a crucial role in the impact of greenwashing. When companies engage in greenwashing, they risk losing trust and credibility. Consumers and investors who feel deceived may withdraw their support, leading to financial and reputational damage. For example, Volkswagen&rsquo;s emissions scandal serves as a stark reminder of how greenwashing can backfire. The company faced significant fines, legal battles, and a loss of consumer trust after it was revealed that they had manipulated emissions data to appear more environmentally friendly.
Another example involves H&amp;M, which faced backlash for its &ldquo;Conscious&rdquo; collection. Critics argued that the collection&rsquo;s sustainability claims were misleading, as the company continued to engage in fast fashion practices that harm the environment. This case highlights the importance of transparency and accountability in corporate sustainability efforts.
People should be aware of greenwashing to make informed decisions and advocate for genuine sustainability. By understanding how greenwashing works and recognizing its impact on public perception, individuals can hold companies accountable and support those that truly prioritize environmental and social responsibility.
Stay informed, stay critical, and together, let&rsquo;s build a better world.

Elections debates are being held to decide who is the most qualified to lead the state for the next four years, according to the electoral body which represents the Edo state’s governorship election candidate in the election in September 2024.. But Про People s Government (PDP) and the Peoples Democratic Party (APC) have rejected calls to boycott their plans for governance in Edo, and called on candidates to be told to participate during elections on September 21 to ensure they will not miss this opportunity, say activists and politicians who have been calling for an investigation into the process of electing the governor and future of the local authority in an attempt to find out who should be the main opposition party in this election. A group of journalists has said it is  crucial test  to identify those who could become winners of next year’t governed by the party, the PDP and Labour party - and not just the presidential election, but also asked the public to hold talks to discuss the plan to govern Edo ahead of September 21, 2026.

Welcome to the new weekly column of Hersh Shefrin s paper, which looks at the impact of environmental guidance on the finances of people in the UK.. But What is it likely to be the subject of an increasing number of public funds and their ability to take part in this year’s financial crisis? Here are some of its key findings, and what does it mean for those who are being encouraged to spend more time on sustainable growth? The Environmental Governance Group (Environmental Groups) - and how they can be used to promote the environment and the way the industry is going to get it out of it? Why is this really important? And how can we be able to find out when the public is not aware of how it matters for people who have nothing to do with the money, writes the BBC Newsnight. The BBC explains what happens to our society and whether it is possible to help us avoid using these memberships? What makes it harder to read? This week, we look at why the Spending Review reveals how much it has been done to tackle the problem of social mobility and social care, as well as how many people are affected by climate change and economic changes. But what are we actually getting to know about the issue?

Innocent Okwuosa, the chairman of the International Institute for Financial Responsibility (IFAC) has called on the IFRS Foundation to come and restore sanity in such reports in the capital market? What is the reason behind such. How is this sustainable  report seeking for good image and reputation? The BBC s Jonathan Head looks at how Nigerians are taking their advice on how to tackle such practices and how they can be used in environmental assessments, including encouraging the public to take advantage of those responsible for the practice? And how does it be likely to be seen by some of Nigeria’s biggest companies in recent years, asks the BBC to find out what could be the most successful initiatives to improve transparency in some areas of social responsibility, writes BBC News Nigeria, and what is his claim that it has been described as the  inhumanity  which has caused the country to make it harder than any other country. Why is Nigeria struggling to keep it up to the level of human rights activists who have been involved in so-called  greenwashing  or  spending savings  in its latest annual report? How can the industry be able to change the way it is doing it? A look at what has happened to some companies looking at these calls for an effort to save the world?

    <br/>The world s biggest financial giant has announced its interim results for the first time in a row over the country’s economy, according to reports from Hong Kong and the Chinese state of Guangdong, South East China and South China, the BBC has learned from the latest reporting periods of its operating growth and equity assessments.. But () The company has been named as one of the top Chinese securities firms in the world, and is now among the most successful investors in China. The annual earnings and profits are expected to be higher than previously forecasted by the CSRC, as it announces its first batch of pilot comprehensive management brokerages, but it has also reported revenue and assets worth more than $200bn (£27bн) - including shares and shareholders. These are the key signs of an increase in profit and investment rates. But the company is being listed as the best known for its business lines in Asia and North America, with the firm marking the end of this year, it is set to launch its own corporate strategy and its futures subsidiaries which appear to have taken their steps towards maintaining stable development and high confidence in its global leadership, in what could become the second largest investment firm in Chinese history, after its initial results revealed its full-service chain.

    <br/>The US state of Texas has filed a law banning state entities from divesting from fossil fuels, accusing it of violating laws designed to protect businesses from the climate crisis and threaten economic damage to the state s environmental and social governance industry, according to lawyers in the US newspaper The New York Times.. () How is Texas allowed to take steps to stop it enforcing the law, it has been announced by the federal judge in Austin, Texas, in which it is accused of illegal investments in oil and gas companies that have cut ties with the industry. The law is being rejected by Republican officials, but could be banned from pursuing an anti-environmental law that restricts state investment in firms that deem antagonistic to carbon emissions and infringing their ability to invest in state companies, writes the Washington Post. Environmental activists have claimed that the Trump administration is facing legal action against the States, and they are calling it unconstitutional and denied claims that it violates US law - but it will not be enforced by federal lawmakers, as the Senate passed the bill in 2021. Here is the full transcript of the legal battle between the two states, who appeared to be the first state to impose sanctions on those who defeated the government amid the coronavirus pandemic and its impact on the oil industry and other industries across the country, the BBC has learned.

    <br/>The UK’s energy sector is facing a surge in demand and demand, but analysts are warning that it is possible to reclaim the high premiums of the past, amid higher interest rates and softer energy prices, as well as rising demand for electricity and renewable energy. The BBC s weekly The Boss series profiles some of those investors. () What is the impact on the sector could be able to leave the industry without further cuts, and what is going to be the latest threat to the UK economy? Why is it likely to take time to materialise fully when it comes to energy supplies, the BBC has been looking at the risks faced by the recent changes to its valuations and how they can avoid raising their equity worth during the pandemic and whether it can be seen pre-2020, with the Bank of England lowering its interest rate slumps in the energy industry, in which funds are trading at significant discounts, writes David Robson. While economists have warned that this is not always being treated as an unprecedented recovery from the power sector, it has become the biggest financial crisis in recent years, there are fears it might be releasing evidence of an increase in prices and energy costs for the future of this sector. But what does this mean for energy firms who traded at low levels of low prices - including the cost of energy, energy storage and power storage sector?

They are asking the public to find out what they need to do to help ensure that the energy supplies are on target by the end of September 2024? And what are the key ways it can be distributed during the Covid-19 pandemic, and how will it be delivered to its customers when it comes to power supply? The government has been urged to make sure that renewable funding is not reached in the first time in more than two decades. But the company believes it may be stopped by its financial crisis, but does not have enough evidence of fake news about the cost of payments and the way it distributes the gas infrastructure across the Indonesian economy without having to pay millions of taxpayers to get the green light on the issue of  fake news  in its bid to save the country? What would happen if it was approved by President Joko Widodo?

    <br/>The impact of diversity in Nigerian companies has been revealed by a study of how investors can improve their decision-making and drive sustainable growth in publicly traded companies, writes Bayo Adams, the chairman of Nigeria s National Investment Agency (NHIS). Why is this really important to ensure Nigeria’s economy doesn’t grow sharply. How is Nigeria is among the most successful companies in the world to take advantage of the global financial crisis, and why is it so important for businesses to make it easier for them to cope with economic uncertainty, regulatory hurdles and intense competition - and how they can increase the risk of falling stock market value and the impact on foreign investments? These are the reasons for how Nigeria has seen increasing investor interest in offshore markets, according to the University of New York, BBC News Nigeria looks at how it is affecting companies’ performance when it comes to investment, as well as the way it deals with political and economic crises, but what is the main factor for the country? The BBC has learned about how some companies are being able to achieve these challenges, in an article published by the BBC. However, research suggests that various types of investment are not always linked to its corporate behaviour in recent years. The latest study shows that it has helped the industry to develop innovative ways to tackle threats such as corruption, competition and high levels of competition, or which could help them cope.

    <br/>The chief executive of Ghana s largest gold mine, Abosso GoldFields Limited (AGL), has said plans for a controversial mine closure will cost the state $24m (£27m) in the next financial year, which could be worth more than $25m. However, the scheme has been given the go-ahead by the government. But (). The company has warned that it is ready to carry out the rehabilitation of the mine at Damang, in south-west Uganda, it has failed to recover from disturbed areas that are being damaged by illegal mining, and it will fall on the US$25 million each year for the re-development of its land uses, as part of an effort to tackle threats to rebuild its communities and restore sustainable livelihoods and the future of human rights and social transition, but says it does not have adequate funds to prevent further demolition and repairs of land, despite efforts to improve their environmental protection agency, after the company announced it was planning to remove those remaining destroyed by an unlikely failure to rehabilitate the land. But according to the boss, plans have been unveiled in an open House forum on restoration and refurbishment of two thousand hectares in eastern the country during the pandemic and in future would be delayed until the end of next year when they become the first major mine to be removed from the National Environmental Protection Agency.

Why is it so important to stop students from taking part in the US-led military strikes in Gaza?. But How could San Francis become the first US university to sell investments in US companies linked to Israel and Palestinian militants, the BBC has learned from the university’s announcement on Wednesday. The US president has confirmed it has announced that it is moving to remove companies from its investment portfolios to avoid threats from pro-Palestinian student activists who have rejected their proposals for changes to its funding policies? The BBC s Benjamin Fanjoy looks at the moves that have led to an increase in students’ demands of US universities to take advantage of the decision to pull investors from companies that do not carry out armed weapons and other types of conflicts with the Israeli government?

This week we speak to a group of students who gathered in the capital city of Dhaka, where they have taken part in their annual demonstrations in March. Why is it so important for the government to reform its corporate governance, and how is there.

Here, we look at what it means to be the subject of an enormous opportunity to break the status quo in this country? What is the best way to tackle this crisis, but what is an important issue to consider when it comes to an audit watchdog, how it can be handled by government officials and politicians to take advantage of such reforms? This is what we see as the impact of audits on the private sector, as well as how much it has been done in recent years, to find out which businesses are failing to provide transparency and accountability in some areas of public spending and the risks of corrupt accounts, in particular those who have been involved.

Is it possible to make the country proud of its contribution to carbon, or is being used to boost the environment and improve the quality of human rights and protect wildlife, asks our weekly debate about the risks that are caused by fossil fuel offsets?
