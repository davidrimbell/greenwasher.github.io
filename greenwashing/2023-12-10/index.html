  <meta name="title" content="Climate Venture Capital Fund Reduces Carbon Emissions and Promotes Sustainability in New Zealand"/>
  <meta name="description" content="The Climate Venture Capital Fund in New Zealand has released its first Impact Report. This report tells us about the emissions from the companies it invests in and how its investments affect the environment. The fund has done a good job of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 69 tonnes in just one year. This shows that the fund is being open and accountable.
The report also talks about the fund&rsquo;s investments in four companies that are working on technologies to reduce emissions. The fund wants to save 1 million tonnes of emissions in the first 10 years. By supporting these companies, the fund is helping in the fight against climate change.
Unfortunately, only 25% of the companies listed on the Nairobi Securities Exchange are following guidelines for reporting on environmental, social, and governance issues. Out of the 61 companies, only 15 have started reporting since the guidelines were released in December 2021. This is a problem because it makes us question if these companies care about sustainability and being responsible.
To fix this problem, the Nairobi Securities Exchange has partnered with the Global Reporting Initiative. They want companies to report on things like community, corruption, and environmental impact. While it&rsquo;s not required, the exchange wants companies to report on sustainability because it can help them make more money and attract investors. It&rsquo;s important for companies to be transparent and build trust with the people they work with.
NEOM, a sustainable development in Saudi Arabia, has started a new food company called Topian. Topian is working to make the food industry better. They want to make sure there is enough food, reduce climate change, and have no emissions. Topian is bringing together scientists, experts, and innovators to make the food industry more sustainable.
Topian&rsquo;s idea of &ldquo;Future to Table&rdquo; is about making food in a better way. They want to produce, distribute, and consume food in a sustainable way. Topian is also working with other organizations to find new and sustainable ways to make food. They want to make the food system more sustainable and strong.
Mining Grid, a startup in Dubai, has created &lsquo;Mining Race&rsquo; to change the mining industry. &lsquo;Mining Race&rsquo; lets people mine Bitcoin and get rewards while helping the community. The &lsquo;Mining Race&rsquo; app is available on iPhones and Android phones and has a safe way to make transactions.
Mining Grid also cares about the environment. They have started the &lsquo;Race to Zero Carbon&rsquo; campaign. They want people to give some of the money they make from mining to projects that help the environment. This is important because the mining industry can be bad for the environment.
In conclusion, these summaries tell us about good and bad things happening in sustainability. The Climate Venture Capital Fund in New Zealand is doing a good job of reporting on the environment. But many companies listed on the Nairobi Securities Exchange are not reporting on sustainability. NEOM&rsquo;s Topian and Mining Grid&rsquo;s &lsquo;Mining Race&rsquo; are working to make the food and mining industries better while being sustainable. We need to be careful and informed about greenwashing. By supporting sustainable companies, we can make a better future for ourselves and future generations.
