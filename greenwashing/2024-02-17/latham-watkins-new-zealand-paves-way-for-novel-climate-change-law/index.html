    <p>The Supreme Court of New Zealand has rejected a claim in court against former climate change spokesperson Paul Smith, which alleged he is responsible for emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) in the country s northern part of the province of Ngpuhi and Ngati Kahu. However, it is not clear that he will leave. (). Why is it possible to take legal action to avoid environmental damages, writes the High Court for the first time in more than two decades, and why is the case going to be prosecuted by the court of Appeal - and it could lead to an inquiry into his claims that corporates are liable for emitting or contributing to Greenhouse Gases in their carbon dioxide and gas emissions. The case has been struck out by an inchoate and public nuisance, but it has also allowed him to proceed to trial over his legal duty of care in tort, as he appears to challenge the decision to legalise the legal process of being involved in an attempt to tackle the issue of carbon neutrality (Environmental Protection Rights Act) complaints over the future of his case. A judge has ruled that the trial is due to begin next week. Here is what does it mean for him and his family, who is facing another threat to stop him from taking part in its legal battle to prevent him losing his life in trial, the BBC understands how it can be handled. This is one of its arguments.</p>
