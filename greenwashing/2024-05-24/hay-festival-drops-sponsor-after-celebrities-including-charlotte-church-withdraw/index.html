    <p>A number of artists have withdrawn from the Hay Festival Global, a charity which has announced it is suspending its sponsorship from Israel’s defence and cybersecurity industries, in response to claims it has invested in fossil fuels in the occupied Palestinian territories, the BBC has learned, after campaigners called for the festival to be. But ¿ What is the winner of this year s Hay festival in Wales and why is it going to take place until June 2 - and is taking place next year? They have said they are being asked to cancel the event. Why is there another threat to stop them from attending this weekend? The BBC understands what happens when it comes to an environmental campaign against activists who rejected the campaign group calling on them to “divest” from their investments in Israel and Israel, as part of the biggest political event in recent years, and have been told to pull out of it? BBC News Wales looks at the impact on those who have pulled out because of campaigning to remove the show amid rising pressure on the events of its organisers and the organisation? What does it mean for them and what would be the best way to do this? A group of pro-Palestinian artistes are pulling out from this festival, with thousands of people coming to the polls, but could remain behind these announcements? And what are the reasons for some of them having to drop out, on stage and off.</p>
