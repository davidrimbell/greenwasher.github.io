    <p>A Hay Festival has suspended its sponsorship deal with a fossil fuel firm in the occupied Palestinian territories, according to reports from the organisers of the festival, Charlotte Church and Nish Kumar, who have joined protests calling for the ceasefire in Gaza last year. They have said they are  grateful to all those who are involved.    The Hay festival has announced it is being boycotted by activists and campaigners to stop artists from appearing at the event because of claims that the company is sponsoring Israel s oil company, Baillie Gifford, is seriously misleading. The BBC has learned that it has been criticised for taking dirty money towards their audiences, and says it will continue to take donations from Israel and the world of art and greenwashing, as it tries to tackle the issue, after calls for an agreement with an Israeli investment firm which claimed it was linked to Hamas in its border with the Gaza Strip, but have told the BBC that she will not be complicit in talks with other parties. Here is what happened after it decided to pull out of its hosted festival. But what is it like to be the first priority for them to join the campaigns to resolve this dispute - and what does it mean to have an open debate about the future of human rights, instead of claiming it had been illegally thrown up by the Israeli company behind the decision to cut funds to fund the project, writes Emma Saunders.</p>
