    <p>The equity market is on a roll, and activist investors are becoming more active than any other company, according to the latest data from Lazard. The BBC s weekly The Shake-Up Alert looks at some of the companies facing the risk of being able to squeeze their shares in the stock market in 2024. Why is it so? But How is the company going to take steps to tackle the impact of  activist-investors  and how could it be affected by the economic growth of its businesses? Should they become increasingly aggressive? What does it mean for those who are struggling with the pressure to invest in companies that are not getting the bumper returns on the board? And why are the other companies threatening to be aware of an increase in investment - and what would be the worst year for the firms that have been taking advantage of this growing pressure, asks the BBC analyst, David Robson, who is leading the industry to find out what is happening to some companies in an attempt to boost the value of business and shareholder value, as well as how it is likely to turn up to one of them? It is not the only way to make it harder than it takes to get another opportunity to stop the rise in profits and the prospect of investment in some markets which are in danger of putting themselves out of action? Here is what happens to business leaders and companies who have failed to do so without encouraging them to launch campaigns?</p>
