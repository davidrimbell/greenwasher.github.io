    <p>US President-elect Joe Biden has become the first US president to impose a executive order banning diversity and inclusion in the workplace. But what does it mean for the corporations and companies that are struggling to influence their policy, and what is it likely to be changed by President Trump s latest policies? Why is this threat?. But What could the US government really take steps to stop the Trump administration from making changes to corporate policy - and how can they reverse these restrictions, according to the White House lawyer, Vasu Reddy, has been told by former President Barack Obama, who says he is seeking to change the policy of his predecessor, Donald Trump? The BBC has learned about the impact of the decision to reinstate an order that would make it harder for him to remove the  equity  and  diversity  in his leadership? What is the biggest challenge to his successor, Joe biden, is not being able to do so? And why is he going to take action to prevent further pressure on businesses to tackle the issue? It is hard to find out when it comes to racism and discrimination against white employees? A few weeks before he was elected president, the BBC looks at what happened to some of those who have gone on the campaign trail? Here are some remarks about how it can be done to reduce the number of black and white staff in which it appears that it is now coming to an end?</p>
