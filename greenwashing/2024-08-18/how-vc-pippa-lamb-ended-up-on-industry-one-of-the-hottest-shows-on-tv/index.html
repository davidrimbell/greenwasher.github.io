    <p>The latest series of HBO shows reveals how they are making a blink-you-might-miss-it quick two- episode comeos. The BBC s weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world, including the UK, the US, Canada, France and Canada. This week we speak to Pippa Lamb, co-creator of the BBC. (). “I m going to be an investor in the industry, and why is it likely that you might not be able to get the opportunity to become an early celebrity in business? Why does it come out? And what happened when you re watching the show? What happens to you? It could be the most successful show of this season?
