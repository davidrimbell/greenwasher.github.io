    <p>Companies and businesses are increasingly concerned about their sustainability efforts. But why is it a matter of concern? Why is greenwashing the latest phrase to be added to the list of those monitoring corporate sustainable initiatives? The BBC s Jonathan Head looks at how it is being treated in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.. () What is the answer to this question is  greenwashing  - and what does it mean for the company and business establishments and how they are doing enough to ensure the environment is safe and safe? What makes it harder for them to do more to protect them from environmental concerns, including climate change and the impact of greenhouse gas emissions and its impact on the global economy? How is this often referred to as the opposite of Greenhushing? It is not always associated with the same word when it comes to human rights and whether it can be used by the public to tackle the risks it has not been taken out of public scrutiny and criticism of its actions? Here is what we heard about the issue. Should it be seen as an example of such an effort to improve the quality of products and products which have been described as  unfair  or  disrespectful  and is there really nothing to think about it? And what is that behind these remarks in recent years? Is it likely to have another term given to companies and firms that are underplaying aggressive attitudes about green safety?</p>
