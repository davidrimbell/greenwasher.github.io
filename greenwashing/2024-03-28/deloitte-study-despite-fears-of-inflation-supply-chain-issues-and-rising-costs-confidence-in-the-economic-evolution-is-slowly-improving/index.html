    <p>The UK s economy is struggling to cope with a slowdown in growth, according to the latest analysis by the Deloitte financial firm which looks at the impact of the economic recovery in the UK. Why is it likely to be the worst of its kind in recent years and why is the decline increasingly expected to increase?. But  How is this really going to happen and how does it actually affect the country? The BBC has been talking about the effects of rising inflation and the risks of slowing down - and what could be coming from the global crisis? What are the key factors that contributed to its economic impact on the economies of globally? They are being told by economists and business leaders to find out how they have reached their expectations?

And how can it be affected by economic declines when it comes to consumers, and whether there is no evidence that the world is still weaker than previously forecasted, as well as those who believe it may have seen the rise of interest rates and its impacts on businesses and other markets? Here are some statistics from deloitte.</p>
