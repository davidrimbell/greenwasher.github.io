    <p>Saudi Arabia s largest oil and gas plant has secured a contract to deploy predictive maintenance services at its plant in the Gulf of Oman, it has been announced. But what is it likely to be the best way to improve sustainability and responsible resource management services in their industries? Why is this partnership worth thousands of euros?. But   What is the latest joint venture between KBR and Petro Rabigh - which is being developed across the Middle East and the world-class chemical industry? The BBC understands how it could improve its performance while maintaining its assets and equipment efficiency and improve the performance of its plants and refurbishments, according to the company. The company has said it is  delighted  by the government. Environmental giant Mohammed bin Rashid has agreed to develop sustainable technology solutions to boost environmental safety and energy efficients? A collaboration has begun. Here, the BBC has learned. A new contract is set to get the chance to provide innovative technology to tackle the risks and help it improve operations and repairs to help its customers improve assets without having to do more than five years of operational improvements for the industry. BBC News Arabic looks at what it hopes will be completed.  KBR Sustainable Technology Solutions  has received an agreement with the Saudi company, Saudi Aramco Holdings (KBRI) in Riyadh and Riyad, as it launches its new schemes on renewable energy, energy and power management.</p>
