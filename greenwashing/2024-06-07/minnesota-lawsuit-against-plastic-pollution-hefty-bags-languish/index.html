    <p>A growing number of lawsuits have been filed against the largest US state in the world, threatening climate change and damages to the environment. But what is it like to be the source of a huge amount of plastic pollution? The BBC s Stephanie Hegarty looks at how the industry is affecting the oceans and waters of the United States.. () What is the story of an environmental group which is being investigated for the first time in five years - and how it is likely to lead to their own legal battle with the burgeoning plastics industry in South Carolina and California, and what does it mean for those who believe they could be involved in dangerous chemicals that destroy the planet? Environmental activists are trying to find out what it means to make plastic waste, as well as why scientists have claimed that the plastic industry has become embroiled in legal action to tackle the global warming, the impact on wildlife and human rights, writes the BBC’s Tom Watson, whose investigation has been launched by the US government to investigate the problem, but what has happened when it comes about recycling plastic products across the country, in an attempt to identify how these particles are spreading in recent years. The latest findings show signs of legal firepower is now increasingly moving closer to trial. Why is this really going to take steps towards the future of humans, to see ways to protect the Earth?</p>
