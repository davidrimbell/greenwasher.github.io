    <p>The Société Generale Group has signed an agreement with the state of Benin to sell its shares in a subsidiary of the Côte d Ivoire, according to reports from the French Financial Conduct Authority (CET1) on Tuesday, 30 July 2024. These are the details of what is expected to be the latest financial acquisitions. But What is this announcement? Why is it going to take place when it comes to the divestment of entities and how could it be worth more than €25m (£27m) to buy the group s stake in the European Bank of Europe? The BBC understands how it will take over the majority of its assets and corporate activities within the Group, as well as why it is likely to have an impact on the UK’s economic growth and the future of his businesses and its business and finances, and what does it mean for the firm? What would it affect the business? BBC News France looks at how the company is preparing for their annual report on which it has been announced - and who is the owner of this group? And how will it make it profitable? A further investigation has begun to find out where they are being investigated by the BBC. The executives have been contacting us in Paris to discuss the process of acquiring investors and shareholders. This is what happens in France. BBC Afrique has learned about the move. Here are some of them explaining what it expects from those involved.</p>
