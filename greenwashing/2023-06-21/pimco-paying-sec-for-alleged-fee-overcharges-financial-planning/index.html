    <p>A US investment firm has agreed to pay $9 million to settle claims that it failed to comply with its obligations to waive advisory fees and explain investors about how a fund makes money, the US Treasury has revealed, amid reports that the firm was involved in financial miscalculations which could be handled by the BBC. () How funds making money worth more than $27m (22m) of investment advice has been submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the first time in nearly 30 years - including the amount it collected from traders in its all Asset All Authority Fund (IPOC) schemes, as part of an investigation into the company s handling of cases against the securities watchdog, US regulators have told the Paradise Papers that their failure to do so has led to an unprecedented row over the way it is being treated in the case. Why is it not allowed to make money for an investment vehicle, and how it was used for moving money into other accounts under management? They are among those accused of failing to meet certain rules, but it will pay millions more to resolve complaints about the risks.</p>
