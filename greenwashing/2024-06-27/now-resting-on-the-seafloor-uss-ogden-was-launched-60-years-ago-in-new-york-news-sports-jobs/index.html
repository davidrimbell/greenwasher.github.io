    <p>The first amphibious landing ship of the United States has been decommissioned at the New York Naval Station, marking the 70th anniversary of its launch. Here are five pictures from the USS Ogden (LPD 5) which was launched on June 27, 1963. This is a summary of what happened in the 1960s and 70s when it was released. But The BBC looks at some of those photographs that have been shared with the BBC s Victoria Derbyshire photographer Larry Burton, who went to the ceremony to mark the 50th year since the launch of it, and what they chose to remember - and their remarkable achievements. They are among the pictures taken by the ogden aircraft carriers who were named after the city of Utah in 1964. The latest images have revealed why the warship was the first to be deployed by US Navy crews in 1963, but what is the story of how it took the time to launch it in 1969. What is it likely to take place in this year? These are the key facts from this week. It is an exhibition of events taking place across the US during the deployment of this giant military vessels, from where it came from, to what it is now known as the World War Two, as well as what could be the most significant moments on the history of US warships being created by British-Canadian fur trapper Peter Skene and whose participation has changed.</p>
