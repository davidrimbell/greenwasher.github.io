    <p>It s the first time that the US government has issued a definition of the  zero emissions building . But what is it likely to mean for buildings that are powered by clean energy and does not have enough greenhouse gases to generate their own electricity generated by climate change? Why is this really so often referred to as being. () How is the new definition is worthwhile and timely - and how could it be based on the same phrases and expressions that can be used to refer to the concept of zero emissions building in the United States? The BBC looks at how they have been making these claims when it comes to building, and what makes it harder for architects, developers and engineers? What is an increasing number of people calling it  net zero, zero carbon negative  and is not going to be described as the  zero emission building ? Should it actually be one of those that have not been labelled as   zero-emission building ? And why is there another threat to make it more dangerous? Is it possible to change the way the world is prepared to get it out of control? It might be the only way it can become the most controversial word in recent years? So what are the reasons behind which it has been made to define the term because of its environmental impact and the impact of global warming? This is what happened in cities and towns in California, California and New York, the BBC has learned.</p>
