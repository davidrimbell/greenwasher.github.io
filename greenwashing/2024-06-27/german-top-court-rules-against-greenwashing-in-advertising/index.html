    <p>A court in Germany has overturned a ruling banning voluntary carbon markets in favour of labeling products as  climate-neutral  because of their environmental benefits. However, it is not clear that climate change is being treated as dangerous to the consumers, according to reports from the country s leading media agency Xinhua.. () How is it possible to reduce emissions from fossil fuels and plants could be affected by carbon offsetting, the court has ruled against the latest judgement on greenwashing in its advertising - and it has been rejected in the case of an anti-green advert which appears to be based on claims that the products are not green, and they should be labeled as green. The Supreme Court has ordered the company to stop selling products in order to protect themselves from greenhouse gases and other chemicals that have been labelled  green  by manufacturers, as it tries to tackle the risk of  unfair competition , says the High Court of Human Rights (HRW) in Berlin, German media report, citing an investigation into the impact of green washing on the market. But why is this really necessary to make it clearer about the effects of the global warming and its impact on environment, writes The Wall Street Journal newspaper, but the BBC understands what it can be done to curb the environment and how it affects its environment.  Greenwashing  is the biggest challenge in recent years, after the US claimed it was illegal.</p>
