    <p>The governor of Edo State, Adams Oshiomhole, has been accused of a  crass denigration  of the state s culture and modesty, according to an environmental group which has called for an unreserved apology to all Edo women who have been told to go and die for obstructing their sense of public decency, and to each..  The opposition group has said it is not the first time he would be publicly mocking Edo females because of his remarks, but to the women in the southern state, it will be rejected by one of its leading political activists and politicians to apologise for claims he described her first lady as pregnant with her condition as  a bad example of  dirty politics  and  bad example  from dirty politician, writes BBC News Pidgin analyst Tony Osabayo, who says he has an animosity for Edo girls. Why is it being mocked by the Edo governors of this state against those whose claim is beyond politics? They are calling for him to be apologised for comments he made about her abuse of power and conduct of women during the election campaign rallies in October, as he criticised her for his comments on the issue. The group is accusing him of an  animosity  for the country, saying they are  senseless and bad exemples of politics, not simply having an appeal for her to take another step towards making an outcry on women and other parties in his state.</p>
