  <meta name="description" content="Greenwashing is when companies pretend to be more eco-friendly than they really are. They make false claims to attract green-minded customers.
Companies use different tricks to greenwash:

They say they are &ldquo;green&rdquo; without proof.
They use labels that make products seem eco-friendly when they aren&rsquo;t.
They talk about small improvements but ignore bigger harmful practices.
They focus on one small eco-friendly thing to hide overall negative impacts.

Some recent examples of greenwashing are:

Fashion brands saying they are sustainable but still making lots of fast fashion.
Energy companies talking about renewable energy while still investing in fossil fuels.
Food companies calling products &ldquo;natural&rdquo; or &ldquo;organic&rdquo; when they aren&rsquo;t truly organic.

Consumers should watch out for greenwashing. They might unknowingly support companies that aren&rsquo;t really eco-friendly. This can harm the environment and slow progress towards sustainability.
Public opinion is important in greenwashing. If people think they are helping the environment by buying from a company, they feel good. But if the claims are false, trust is lost. This hurts not only the company but the whole industry.
A good example is Volkswagen. When it was revealed they cheated on emissions tests, their reputation suffered. This made people question other car companies too.
In short, consumers should be careful to avoid greenwashing and support truly sustainable businesses. By demanding honesty and transparency, they can push for a greener marketplace.
