    <p>The Watershed Institute has been awarded a $1m (£1m) water and environment grant for its streamWatch Schools programme in the US state of Ohio, which aims to promote the environmental stewardship and personal well-being in schools across the country, and encourage students to connect with the natural world and explore their ability to explore the world.. But What is the BBC s Jamie Bartlett explains how the programme is being developed by an American Water Charitable Foundation. Why is it going to be given the green light and how it can be used to monitor water quality lessons in some areas of the United States, it has become the first US community to benefit from funding to expand its teaching programme. The BBC understands what it is likely to have been created by the water watchdog to help them increase the number of children taking part in an effort to boost educational growth in US communities during the coronavirus pandemic and its impact on climate change and the impact of human health and mental health? They are among those who have received an award for helping teachers to develop innovative ways to teach STEM skills to students and students in rural society? What does it mean for them to spend more time using the technology and technology, engineering and maths, as well as how to improve the environment and provide opportunities for teenagers to access water - and what could be the result of this scheme, writes the University of Florida chief executive Jim Waltman, who says the project has won the award.</p>
