    <p>The first investigation into environmental claims made by fashion businesses in the UK has revealed a raft of new powers for consumer protection and competition law. The BBC s weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world, including the impact of their products on the environment, and why they do not comply with the Competition and Markets Act.  But What is the BBC looks at how the industry is taking steps to tackle the risks of  greenwashing  claimed by consumers in England and Wales. Here is what happens to the business industry and how it is affecting climate change and its impact on its environment and the future of the global economy - and what does it mean for them to be able to avoid further damages from greenwashing. This week we speak to businesses who are being warned about increasing risk associated with making green complaints, in which corporates are facing more severe fines and whether to stop them from profiting from misleading Environmental threats that could lead to an enforcement of consumer law, to find out what is likely to take place next year. What are the key lessons on how to protect themselves from rising levels of harmful and unambiguous information about the effects of Greenwashing, as part of its latest findings. How is it going to make it harder to do so? Why is there growing concerns about greenwashing? What would be the answer to this question when it comes into public safety?</p>
