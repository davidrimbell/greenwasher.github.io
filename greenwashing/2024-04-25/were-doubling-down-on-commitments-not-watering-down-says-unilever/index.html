    <p>The chief executive of Unilever, Hein Schumacher, has rejected claims that he was behind a series of environmental and social pledges which he says have been reached by his predecessor, Alan Jope, in the latest round of the companys sustainability targets, according to the BBC s The Boss report on the business.. But Here How could the firm become the first giant in Europe to achieve its sustainable goals, he has been quoted as the boss of one of its biggest consumer goods firms, and why he is being criticised for his failure to carry out the work of his new boss, Martin Luther King has said he wants to change his business when he comes out of action to tackle climate change and the impact of greenhouse gas emissions threats in recent years? Why is it likely to be thrown out by the new chairman, who claimed he had failed to meet his ambitious ambitions for the future of food and drinks? The company is facing another row over Environmental and Social Responsibility (Environmental Governance Strategy) plans. They say he will not be the next boss in his job, as he defeated his decision to step down from his position. The boss has refused to criticise him for refusing to do so, after he resigned from corporate efforts to boost the global economy, saying he did not want to spend more money in order to save the food industry, writes the New York Times, BBC News Arabic has learned.</p>
