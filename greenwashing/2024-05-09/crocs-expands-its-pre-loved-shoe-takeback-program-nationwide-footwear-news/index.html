    <p>Luxury footwear firm crocs has launched a national expansion in the US to help consumers drop off their old pairs of shoes for the next life. The company has announced that it is expanding its programme to tackle fashion waste in cities across the world, including Florida and Puerto Rico, and the Isle of Man, in Florida, Arizona and Arizona.. But () The US company says it will be able to give each pair its next best use to avoid being thrown out of the shoe. Why is it likely to be one of its biggest challenges in its effort to combat climate change and make it easier for shoppers to drop them away from wearable clothes, but it has now opened stores and outlet locations in America to offer them discounts on the cost of buying them in order to save the lives of them? They say they have been given an extra 10 percent discount on all shops in some states in an attempt to stop using them during the coronavirus pandemic, as it launches its first phase of an initiative that aims to boost sustainability and help those who have used the products? The BBC s weekly The Boss series looks at how the company is developing its new ways to take advantage of this growing programme of shoe takeback schemes, with the aim of helping them to make savings from the fashion industry and create businesses and work with environmental activists and business leaders to find out what it hopes is the first time it can be used to remove them.</p>
