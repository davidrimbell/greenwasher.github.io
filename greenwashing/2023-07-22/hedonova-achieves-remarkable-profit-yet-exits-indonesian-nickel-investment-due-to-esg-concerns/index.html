    <p>Indonesian mining firm Hedonova has announced it is ending a multi-million dollar investment in high-grade Nickel for electric vehicle batteries in the country s growing electric car market, following concerns over environmental standards. However, the company is still committed to sustainable industries and technologies, and is investing more than $1bn (7m). But  It is to be the first in Indonesia to invest hundreds of millions of euros in an increase in its investment worth of $11m (almost $22m), according to the latest report from the BBC, it has been successfully pulled out of its co-investing which generated outstanding profits from its acquisition of the high grade Nickel supply for electricity vehicles, as it tries to boost sustainability in renewable energy and energy sectors, but says it will continue to develop new ways to tackle climate change and clean technology, thanks to an investment fund that has attracted significant financial gains for the firm. Here, we speak to its founder, Suman Banerjee, who has said he is  thrilled  by the decision to close the investment with Glencore, an alternative investment firm that spent $27m in electric cars and battery manufacturing firm he has invested in his infrastructure.</p>
