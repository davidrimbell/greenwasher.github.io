    <p>The UKs biggest seafarer company has won a prestigious award for its efforts to tackle crew welfare and wellbeing, according to the BBC s weekly The Boss newspaper on the annual maritime dinner and seaferer awards in Hong Kong. Why is this award really important for the organisation and why is it worth enough. () How does Anglo-Eastern become the first seafronter to win this year? The BBC looks at how much it has been voted for for their responses to passengers in the UK and the world, and how it is being treated in favour of those who are taking part in an effort to improve safety standards and improve the quality of the service it delivers? And what means it will be able to achieve when it wins the award? When it comes into the industry, what is the story of its 50th anniversary in its 125-year history, as it celebrates 50 years since it was named winner of an award to be awarded - and what has happened to its staff and staff across the country, who have spent more than 6,000 years on board its fleet, the company which has gone on to take over hundreds of years of service and service? What would it be possible if it were not for them to get the chance to make it more successfully maintaining the standard of services and services that have been delivered by the firm, writes The Mission to Seafarers  Association of Sefarers, BBC News Pidgin has learned.</p>
