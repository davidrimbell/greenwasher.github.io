    <p>A new AI-powered platform has been launched in a growing number of Albertsons Cos departments in the US state of Idaho, the company behind it has announced. Why is it so challenging for the department managers to keep coolers and freezers light, and why does it actually be worth millions of dollars in an effort to reduce food. (). The company is planning to launch an artificial intelligence platform to help tackle shrink across the supply chain, according to reports from US regulators, it will be used to provide accurate ordering for high-value, hyper-perishable items such as bacon, baco and fish, in order to boost supplies and boost in-stock rates and reduce the cost of the food and seafood waste during the Covid-19 pandemic and the impact on the future of its businesses? Jamie Bartlett says it is  thrilled  with the launch of an ambitious initiative to deliver savings from AI - which aims to improve the way it deals with cutting and production of fresh food, as well as keeping fridges sharply lower-moving, pre-packed chickens or poultry, to save hundreds of tonnes of fish and meat cuts and delivering goods to the public? Afresh is launching its new platform in more than 2,200 stores within their warehouses instead of banner shops? The BBC understands how they are being able to make it more efficiently and quickly to take advantage of AI.</p>
