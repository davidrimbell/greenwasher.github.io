    <p>When a new sustainability-linked bond (SLB) was printed by Enel, it seems that it would have to pay higher coupons on its targets. But what does it mean for those who fail to achieve their goals? The BBC s Christine Blasey looks at what it is likely to be coming to the spotlight.  () But What is going to become the most successful bonds in the world, which have been published by the UKs enel giant, the AFII, has told the BBC that they have reached its target on environmental and governance benefits, and could it be one of the biggest challenges in developing the structure? Why is it so often claimed - and what is the best way it can achieve it? It is not always enough to make it harder than expected, but when it comes to an increasing number of investors being asked for it to take steps up towards sustainable growth, writes David Robson, who believes it will be the first time it has been made to print it in 2021? And why is this one really very hard to get it out of doubt? What makes it possible for the company to keep making it more prominently in recent years, is that there are signs that some companies are failing to meet the target of one in one, or even another threat to stop it from printing it, as the US economy appears like it may be at risk.</p>
