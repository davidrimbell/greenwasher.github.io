    <p>US President Joe Biden has announced a $5.5bn (4.5b) funding boost to address the growing crisis of housing. The White House has said it is taking steps to tackle the US economy, which has seen thousands of families struggling to afford rent or homeownership without their basic income. But what is this growth, and why is it really important for those in the United States to be able to survive the coronavirus pandemic and how they are being treated? The BBC s Christine Blasey looks at what happens to homelessness in cities and local communities across the country. Why is the Trump administration announcing that the government is expanding on its historic efforts to boost the number of homeowners spending more than half of the total amount of money spent on households in some areas of US history, writes the Washington Post - and what does it mean for Americans? Where are the key issues behind these announcements and whether it can be addressed by the president? And how could it be tackled by his predecessor, Kamala Harris, becoming the first US president to launch an emergency effort to combat the nationwide financial crises, asks what it has been known as the  America Dream  and the way it deals with homeless residents in America? What would be the biggest threat to the American Dream, the BBC has learned from his latest speech on the issue of houselessness, as well as how much it will be done.</p>
