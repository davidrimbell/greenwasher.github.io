    <p> Vice President Kamala Harris and her administration s climate policies are driving a shift away from a  fossil-fuel society  towards a  green economy.  However, this transition is causing significant hardship for hardworking Americans and the global poor. The push for renewable energy and the implementation of radical climate policies have led to increased energy costs, with the national average price of electricity rising by 30% since January 2021. In California, where Harris endorsed policies like a cap-and-trade carbon tax, electricity prices have nearly doubled, resulting in power disconnections for tens of thousands of people.  The rising energy costs are exacerbating inequality, as many families struggle to pay their bills, cutting into their savings and outpacing what they can afford. This trend is particularly devastating in developing nations, where millions still lack access to electricity. The situation is worsening, with a decrease in global access to electricity for the first time in decades.  The crisis is self-imposed, as progressive Democrats have promised policies that would further increase energy costs and hinder the American Dream of ownership and upward mobility. However, there is evidence that policymakers can reduce energy costs and restore the American Dream. Under the Trump administration, energy jobs were brought back, the United States became an energy exporter, and average American families saved $2500 a year compared to current costs.  As more Americans face poverty and darkness due to radical climate policies, it is ironic that Kamala Harris wants to continue this trend in her energy plans for the next four years. The challenge lies in finding a balance between transitioning to a green economy and ensuring that no one is left behind in the process.</p>
