    <p> BGEN, a UK-based engineering company, has opened a new office in Barrow-in-Furness to support its growth plans and cater to the needs of its clients. The company, which specializes in mechanical, electrical, instrumentation, control, and automation, aims to capitalize on opportunities with BAE Systems and provide services to various industries, including energy, manufacturing, and nuclear. The new office, located at Trinity Enterprise Centre, will focus on engineering, design, and project management, adding to the existing office s expertise in electrical, installation, and instrumentation works.  The expansion will offer businesses in the area access to advice and support on various aspects of the project cycle, such as engineering, design, project controls, planning, procurement, risk management, construction methodology, health and safety, quality, environment, and sustainability. Glyn Shawcross, the engineering and design director at BGEN, emphasized the company s commitment to recruiting locally and supporting schools, colleges, and community initiatives.  In addition to its business operations, BGEN has pledged to increase its support for local schools, colleges, and community initiatives. The company is already a sponsor of Barrow Raiders and is actively seeking sponsorship opportunities with other sports clubs. BGEN is also looking to partner with charities and food banks as part of its ESG plan in the area. The plan includes collaborations with schools and colleges to help future generations understand the role of engineering in the world and attract more people to the profession.
