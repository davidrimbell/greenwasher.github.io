    <p> New Zealand businesses face an opportunity to enhance their commitment to social responsibility, as revealed by Kantar and the Sustainable Business Council (SBC) in their inaugural Better Futures Thrive Report. The report identifies a gap in social sustainability action, with only 22% of consumers believing businesses are significantly addressing community and social challenges.  The research highlights three spheres of influence on consumer perception of business social responsibility:  1. Employee perceptions: New Zealand employers are generally seen positively in fostering a culture where employees feel welcome and encouraged to bring their authentic selves to the workplace. However, 45% of New Zealanders have experienced discrimination at work or while seeking employment, with issues such as country of origin, culture, age, and gender being the most common. Employees prioritize authenticity, social harm of a company s products, and valuing staff as the key challenges they want their employer to address.  2. Societal perceptions: Kiwi consumers are most concerned about business efforts to create a positive societal impact through products, services, and community contributions. The priority challenge is having a visible impact, as this significantly influences consumer perception. Issues around diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) are impacting consumer purchasing behavior, with 22% claiming that DEI often or always affects their purchase decisions.  3. Consumer perceptions of brands: Major Kiwi brands are seen as underperforming in engaging with social issues, addressing inequity, reflecting society, and community outreach. Service industry brands with more regular and visible consumer interaction are rated higher on DEI delivery.  The Better Futures Thrive Report emphasizes the need for New Zealand businesses to take visible engagement and meaningful action on social issues to meet consumer expectations. The report, based on the perspectives of 1,000 New Zealanders, can be downloaded online for further insights.  Margin of error: ±5% points at the 95% confidence level.
