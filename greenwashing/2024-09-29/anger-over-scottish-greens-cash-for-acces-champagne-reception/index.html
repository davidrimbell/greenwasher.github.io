    <p> Solar Energy Scotland, a lobbying trade body, sponsored an exclusive event at the Scottish Greens party conference, where only senior party members and MSPs were invited. The event, which cost £700, was criticized for being a paid opportunity to discuss government matters with ministers. The Scottish Greens conference, held in October of the previous year, also saw the announcement of a new policy to boost solar energy provision in Scotland.  The event was not listed in the lobbying register by Solar Energy Scotland or in any records of ministerial meetings. The reception was attended by senior party members, including Lorna Slater, and was not open to the public. Critics, including National columnist Ellie Gomersall and Greens candidate Niall Christie, expressed discomfort with the arrangement, citing concerns about transparency and the involvement of major polluters as members of Solar Energy Scotland.  George Baxter, vice chairman of Solar Energy Scotland, stated that the organization had communicated with all political parties, including the Greens, over several months to discuss solar energy s potential for decarbonization and job creation. He clarified that he did not participate in policy discussions beyond welcoming the announcement made at the event.  The Scottish Greens spokesman defended the event, stating that there was no discussion of government business and that it was an informal reception open to MSPs, councillors, and sponsors. The spokesman also mentioned that any discussions with ministers were recorded through their private offices.  Despite the spokesman s statement, critics continue to question the transparency and ethics of the event, calling for the Scottish Greens to uphold their values of radical democracy and transparency.</p>
