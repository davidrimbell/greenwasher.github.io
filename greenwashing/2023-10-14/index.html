  <meta name="description" content="The palm oil industry, responsible for 40% of global trade volume in vegetable oils, is facing significant challenges related to sustainability, violence, and deforestation. Reports of human rights abuses and environmental destruction are common, as the industry is a primary driver of deforestation, threatening wildlife and biodiversity. As consumers, we play a role in supporting the industry, but avoiding palm oil may not be the best solution. Instead, we should look for products made with certified sustainable palm oil and pressure companies for higher sustainable standards.
In other news, GITEX Impact has announced the selection of 300 Impact Leaders from various sectors and regions for the year 2023.

The concept of &ldquo;green capitalism&rdquo; is being discussed as a solution to climate change. While many capitalist leaders and companies are investing in green technologies, this approach is flawed as it ignores the systemic aspects of capitalism that contribute to environmental destruction. Technology alone is not enough to prevent extinction; larger systemic changes are needed. The practice of &ldquo;greenwashing&rdquo; by corporations, where they promote themselves as environmentally friendly without making substantial changes, is also criticized in the article.

JK Tyre &amp; Industries, a leading tyre manufacturer in India, has been graded &ldquo;Very Good&rdquo; for the second consecutive year by CareEdge Research in their ESG assessment study.

Investors who want to prioritize sustainability are facing increasing challenges. The definition of sustainability has expanded beyond excluding certain industries to now include concepts like materiality and the overlap between climate and nature. Greenwashing and green hushing remain problems, as companies may make vague net-zero targets without clear timelines or scientific basis. Other complexities in sustainable investing include determining materiality and considering planetary boundaries and nature-related risks.
In conclusion, the fight against greenwashing and the promotion of sustainability are ongoing battles. It is essential for consumers to be aware of the practices of industries and companies they support and to demand higher sustainable standards. Collaboration and meaningful connections among leaders and entrepreneurs are crucial in driving progress towards a more sustainable future.
