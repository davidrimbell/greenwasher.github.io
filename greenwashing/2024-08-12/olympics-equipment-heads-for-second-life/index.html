    <p>The streets of Paris have been empty, the stadiums are closed and a huge number of venues have gone on display. But what happens to all the equipment they need for this year s Paris Olympics - and what is going to happen to the sporting extravaganza when it goes ahead. What is it like to be released. (). Why does it happen? Should it be over? And why is this really happening? What happened to those who could be prepared for these spectacular events? How do you get ready for the next stage of the year? Is it possible to make it more likely to go on? So what would you need to have to do with the events that remain without their permission? The BBC has learned about the possibility of an explosion in the building, which has already taken place, and how is the world behind it? and is there another threat to stop being thrown out of space? It is not impossible to find out where it will be, but what are the things that are needed to take place in 2024? But how do organisers want to change the way the event is under way? A massive waste is still taking place during the summer celebrations in Paris, with thousands of people waiting for them to get away from the crowds, as the city looks at the  second life  of its athletes and the other places that were destroyed by the coronavirus pandemic, how might it take?</p>
