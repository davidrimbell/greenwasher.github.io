  <meta name="description" content="The Competition Bureau Canada is looking into Lululemon Athletica after complaints from Stand.earth. They say Lululemon may be tricking customers with fake green marketing. Lululemon&rsquo;s reports show a big rise in carbon emissions, which makes people doubt their commitment to being eco-friendly.
Stand.earth wants Lululemon to switch to renewable energy and stop using coal. They think it&rsquo;s important for companies to be honest about their environmental actions. If Lululemon is found guilty of lying, they might have to pay fines and take down misleading ads. This shows that brands need to prove they are really helping the environment.
Lululemon says they are reducing greenhouse gas emissions and want to have zero emissions by 2050. But the investigation is still going on, so we don&rsquo;t know the final results yet.
For women who care about the environment and want to leave a better world for their kids, it&rsquo;s important to understand greenwashing. Companies may pretend to be eco-friendly when they&rsquo;re not. By learning the truth and supporting businesses that are truly sustainable, we can help create a better marketplace for everyone.
