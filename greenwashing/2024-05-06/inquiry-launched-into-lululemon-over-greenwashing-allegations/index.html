    <p>Canadian clothing giant Lululemon has launched an inquiry into the company s environmental impacts, according to reports released by a group of members of the Environmental Protection Agency (Environmental Agency) in Vancouver, Canada, on Monday, 17 February, and says it is investigating claims that it was misleading customers about its carbon footprint in the industry.. () But The company is being investigated by the competition agency, Stand.earth, has told the BBC, it will investigate the firm following complaints about climate change and its emissions targets, as it tries to tackle the impact of greenhouse gas exposure to its products and activities in 2022, but does not believe it has been  deceptive  - which appears to be linked to the global warming industry, in an attempt to reduce the cost of making and delivery of clothing to make it more sustainable and more environmentally-friendly clothes and clothing industry against the coronavirus pandemic, writes The New York Times  weekly The Boss report revealed it had failed to meet its target by 2030, despite warnings that they have been using their slogan  Be Planet  as part of its  climate-neutral  campaigns in January. Why is it so far going to do so without proof of any wrongdoing in its own reporting, after it emerged that its impact on the environment has risen to nearly 1.7 million tonnes of carbon levels. The latest report has shown that sustainability is  unsustainable .</p>
