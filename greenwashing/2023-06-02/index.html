  <meta name="description" content="Kenya Takes a Step Towards Plastic Pollution Reduction
Kenya is making significant progress in its efforts to reduce plastic pollution with the launch of design guidelines for the recyclability of plastic packaging. The Kenya Plastics Pact, a collaboration between plastic packaging manufacturers, importers, and exporters, has released its first version of the guidelines. The aim is to ensure that 100% of plastic packaging in the country is reusable or recyclable by 2030.
The guidelines have been reviewed and approved by all 40 official members and supporters of the Pact. They emphasize the need to rethink packaging design to improve recyclability while maintaining functionality. By adopting these guidelines, Kenya is taking a crucial step towards a more sustainable future.
To further increase awareness and commitment to the guidelines, the Kenya Plastics Pact has also announced an innovation challenge. This challenge aims to encourage individuals and businesses to come up with innovative solutions to plastic packaging waste. By fostering creativity and collaboration, the Pact hopes to accelerate progress towards its ambitious goals.
Schneider Electric Launches Sustainability School
Schneider Electric, a global leader in energy management and automation, has launched the Schneider Electric Sustainability School. This free digital platform offers interactive courses to help companies and professionals improve their sustainability performance. Initially launched internally for Schneider employees, the program is now available externally for professionals and companies of all sizes.
The training platform is particularly aimed at small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that may lack the knowledge and tools to establish climate targets and measure carbon emissions. The curriculum is divided into three chapters covering topics such as energy efficiency, renewable energy, and sustainable transportation. By providing accessible and practical training, Schneider Electric aims to empower participants to take climate action and create a more sustainable future.
The Importance of Green Leases in Real Estate
Green leases have become increasingly important in the non-domestic real estate sector, with a focus on energy efficiency and sustainability. Beyond the Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards (MEES) legislation, green leases have evolved to include more rigorous requirements. Landlords are now more willing to include obligations on tenants and make their own commitments to sustainability.
The rise of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives and the UK government&rsquo;s commitment to net-zero carbon have further emphasized the importance of green leases. Drafting of green leases now includes meeting specified standards, adopting sustainable behaviors, and data sharing. While challenges remain in renewals and enforceability, the trend towards green leases is clear.
Companies Face Pressure to Address Climate Change Risks
Climate change presents both risks and opportunities for companies, and they are increasingly being pressured to demonstrate a credible plan. The energy efficiency of buildings owned or occupied by companies is a crucial area to have a holistic strategy for. However, companies must be cautious of greenwashing, making unsubstantiated or misleading environmental claims.
To avoid reputational and liability risks, companies need to provide clear and detailed reporting. Failure to comply may result in trouble from regulators, the press, and potential litigation. It is essential for companies to proactively address environmental risks and have a realistic plan for managing their real estate.
Ecuador Embraces Green Technology
Ecuador has taken a significant step towards embracing green technology with the signing of a decree allowing BacTech Environmental Corp. to construct its bioleaching plant in Tenguel. The plant will be built with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles in mind and will provide higher wages for workers compared to farming.
BacTech aims to use bioleaching, a process that uses naturally occurring bacteria to extract metals from ores, concentrates, and tailings. The company is also seeking certification as an issuer of Green Bonds to finance the plant. The plant&rsquo;s construction is expected to contribute to the growing green mining industry, which is projected to reach $12.9 billion by 2024.
The Importance of Green Accounting
Green accounting, also known as environmental accounting, is becoming increasingly important for businesses. It involves tracking and evaluating a company&rsquo;s efforts to protect the environment and reduce its carbon footprint. Transitioning to green accounting can benefit businesses by protecting the planet, attracting environmentally conscious customers, and decreasing long-term costs.
Accounting firms can play a crucial role in helping businesses adopt green accounting practices. This includes training staff on green accounting principles, understanding clients&#39; businesses beyond financial reporting, and creating accurate sustainability reports. By incorporating sustainability metrics into performance evaluations, businesses can create a more sustainable future.
