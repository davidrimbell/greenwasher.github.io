    <p>The Olympics and Paralympic Games in Paris have been a hugely anticipated event, but it is not always likely that they will be involved in legal challenges, writes the BBC s Stephanie Hegarty, who looks at the legacy of this year’s events. Why is it so important to choose those who will compete in 2024. () How could this really mean the start of the pandemic - and why will it be possible to take place when the world goes to the top of their tournaments, and what is going to be the biggest sporting event in the history of sport, which has already reached the peak of Covid-19 and how will the country become the first athletes to compete at this time? What would it mean for the next few years? And what does it happen to Russia and the Russians who are taking part in this big political event? Should it actually be an opportunity to achieve these athletic events? The BBC explains what will happen until the end of next year, as well as how it can be done to make it harder for us to know how to do it, how might it take to get the chance to win the finals? How will this be happened? So what are the legal issues that have dominated the hosting events and will involve lawyers or officials to help them secure the title of one of its most important events in recent years, in particular, if it comes from the coronavirus outbreak, what can happen in 2020? A row over the possibility that it will have to happen?</p>
