    <p> Trinity College received €2.5 million from Ryanair, furthering the partnership that began in 2021 with the establishment of the Ryanair Aviation Research Centre. The Centre, with a total donation of four million, focuses on researching sustainable aviation fuel, aligning with Ryanair s claim of being the  EU s greenest airline . However, Ryanair s past controversies, including greenwashing and climate change denial by CEO Michael O Leary, cast doubt on the company s commitment to sustainability.  Despite Ryanair s high seat density allowing for lower CO2 emissions per passenger kilometer, the airline s overall emissions are still significant. O Leary s skepticism towards climate change and his comparison of SAF to  cooking oil  further undermine the validity of Ryanair s sustainability strategy.  Trinity s partnership with Ryanair, which includes support for interactions with regulators and policy makers, raises concerns about the potential influence of the airline s controversial stance on climate issues. Additionally, Ryanair s involvement in conferences with oil companies like Shell, which have faced greenwashing controversies, further complicates the partnership.  Trinity s association with Ryanair and its Aviation Centre may not align with the college s values, as it risks endorsing a company with a history of environmental controversies. The Centre s research on sustainable aviation fuel, while valuable, does not address the root issue of overconsumption and may inadvertently support Ryanair s expansion plans.  In conclusion, Trinity s partnership with Ryanair and the Aviation Centre may not be in line with the college s commitment to sustainability. The association with a company known for its controversial stance on climate change and greenwashing practices may hinder Trinity s ability to stand up for its students and promote genuine environmental activism.</p>
