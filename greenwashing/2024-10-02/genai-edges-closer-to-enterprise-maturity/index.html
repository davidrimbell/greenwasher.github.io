  <meta name="description" content=" Enterprise Strategy Group s research reveals that IT leaders are prioritizing generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) projects to enhance productivity and operational efficiency. Despite a 70% increase in investment over the past year, less than 10% of IT decision-makers have deployed GenAI in live environments, with only 8% in mature production. However, there has been a significant rise in early production (36%) and pilot projects (22%), indicating that over a quarter of IT executives are involved in GenAI initiatives.  The IT department is the primary beneficiary of AI deployments, with GenAI being used in an average of 3.5 application areas. Software development is the top application, with 41% of respondents utilizing GenAI for tasks such as test script generation, troubleshooting, code reviews, and documentation. PwC has identified additional use cases, including automatic generation of user stories, acceptance criteria, test cases, and APIs.  Other areas experiencing increased GenAI usage include research, IT operations (7% growth), and cybersecurity (6% growth). AI-driven automation is being employed to optimize cloud operations and enhance customer experiences, while GenAI s pattern recognition and natural language processing capabilities are being leveraged to strengthen cybersecurity defenses.  Organizations with mature AI deployments are more likely to use GenAI for software development, IT operations, and finance. The survey also highlights the importance of using internal data to support GenAI initiatives, as 84% of IT leaders believe it is crucial for their organization to train its own models. Two-thirds of IT leaders use multiple LLMs for GenAI deployment, with 9% using five or more.  In conclusion, while GenAI adoption is still in its early stages, IT leaders are recognizing its potential to improve productivity and operational efficiency. The focus is shifting towards early production and pilot projects, with a growing emphasis on using internal data to train customized GenAI models. This trend is expected to continue as organizations seek to harness the power of AI to drive innovation and enhance their competitive advantage."/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://green-washer.com/greenwashing/2024-10-02/genai-edges-closer-to-enterprise-maturity/">
