  <meta name="description" content=" Angelina Jolie announced a bipartisan update to the Violence Against Women Act at a news conference on Feb. 9, 2022. The Bentley-Gallup Business in Society Survey highlights the challenges businesses face in being socially responsible amidst a polarized political climate. The survey reveals varied public expectations on societal issues, with a majority desiring businesses to take a stand on climate change, diversity, equity, and mental health. However, businesses are cautious about alienating stakeholders and are hesitant to publicly endorse their initiatives.  The survey also notes a decline in social progress in countries like the U.S., UK, Syria, and Venezuela. Despite this, businesses have the potential to be a force for good, with clear priorities from employees and consumers, such as ethical practices, quality healthcare benefits, mental health support, and flexible work arrangements.  To navigate this complex landscape, businesses can focus on the social issues most important to their stakeholders, engage in  Lobbying for Good  to influence legal and regulatory contexts, and create opportunities for citizen engagement in co-creating solutions to social challenges.  The report suggests that business leaders should ask questions, listen, and learn to determine a strategy. It emphasizes the importance of commitment to change beyond superficial measures, as businesses have the power to make a significant impact on societal issues. The future of corporate social responsibility lies in seizing the opportunity to address the concerns of employees and consumers, rather than reverting to a narrow focus on profit and legal compliance."/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://green-washer.com/greenwashing/2024-10-02/the-best-choice-for-business-leaders-is-social-change/">
