  <meta name="description" content=" DAABON UK, a subsidiary of the global sustainable agriculture leader DAABON Group, has introduced the world s first carbon-neutral organic palm oil. This innovative product not only meets the European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) but also sets a new standard for sustainability in the palm oil industry. The carbon-neutral organic palm oil has a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) CO2eq of -977kg per tonne, significantly lower than industry averages.  The palm oil, produced at DAABON s CI Tequendama SAS mill in Colombia, is certified sustainable and complies with the ISO 14067 standard. The company s commitment to sustainability is further demonstrated by its various accreditations, including RSPO, Fair Trade, Regenerative Organic Certification, Organic Certification, and Non-GMO Project.  DAABON s carbon-neutral palm oil aims to help customers reduce their Scope 3 carbon emissions and drive sustainability improvements. The company plans to replicate this achievement at its other refinery and eventually make all its palm oil carbon-negative and climate-positive.  As a signatory of The Climate Pledge, DAABON is committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. The company has also been recognized as the most transparent palm oil producer in the world by SPOTT for its Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) policies.  DAABON s carbon-neutral organic palm oil is now available, and more information can be found on their website (https://www.daabonuk.com/). The DAABON Group, founded in 1914, employs over 2,500 people and has offices across five continents.  In summary, DAABON UK s carbon-neutral organic palm oil represents a significant step forward in sustainable agriculture, setting a new standard for the industry and demonstrating the company s commitment to combating climate change and promoting sustainability."/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://green-washer.com/greenwashing/2024-10-02/daabon-launches-world-first-carbon-neutral-palm-oil/">
