  <meta name="description" content="In today&rsquo;s world, people care a lot about the environment. But some companies try to trick customers by pretending to be more eco-friendly than they really are. This is called &lsquo;greenwashing.&rsquo; It can be bad for both people and the planet.
In the Netherlands, MSC Cruises got in trouble for this. The Dutch Advertising Code Committee told them to stop making certain claims in their ads. MSC said they would reach &ldquo;net zero by 2050&rdquo; and called liquefied natural gas a clean fuel. Groups like Fossil Free Netherlands said MSC was not being honest because they still used fossil fuels. This was an important move to stop companies from greenwashing, as European regulators are watching more closely.
In Canada, new changes to the Competition Act try to stop greenwashing. But they still don&rsquo;t fully protect investors from being misled. The Quebec Environmental Law Centre says there should be clear rules for companies about being green. As new financial products come out, it&rsquo;s important to make sure they are labeled correctly.
In the United States, even though the SEC&rsquo;s Climate &amp; ESG Task Force is no longer active, ESG enforcement is still happening. In California, companies like Tyson Foods face lawsuits for claiming to be greener than they are. Companies need to be ready for new climate rules and should not lie about their environmental efforts, even as the SEC slows down because of the upcoming election.
Consumers need to understand product labels to make smart choices. In the coffee industry, labels like Fairtrade and direct trade can be confusing. A good guide can help people understand these claims and avoid being tricked by greenwashing.
People should watch out for greenwashing to help make a better world for the future. By asking for honesty and holding companies responsible, we can stop false claims and work towards real sustainability.
Public opinion is important when it comes to greenwashing. When companies lie about being green, they can lose their good name and customers&#39; trust. For example, Volkswagen&rsquo;s emissions scandal hurt their image and sales. Customers felt betrayed and stopped buying their cars.
Another example is H&amp;M&rsquo;s &ldquo;Conscious&rdquo; collection. People said the company was not honest about being eco-friendly because they still made fast fashion. This showed why honesty is important in environmental claims.
By knowing how greenwashing affects public opinion, consumers can make better choices and hold companies responsible. This awareness can push for real change and encourage businesses to be truly sustainable, helping both the environment and society.

    <br/> CIMB Bank and CIMB Islamic Bank have announced a strategic partnership with Credit Guarantee Corporation Malaysia Berhad (CGC) to inject an additional RM1.5 billion into a portfolio guarantee scheme aimed at supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Malaysia. This initiative brings CIMB s total working capital financing for SMEs to RM6.5 billion, with a focus on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) adoption, digitalisation, and investment in strategic technologies.  The agreement was signed by CIMB Bank s head of SME banking, group commercial banking, Jaya Balan Kathiravalu, and CGC s chief business officer Sean Tan. The event was witnessed by CIMB Group s CEO Novan Amirudin, CGC s CEO Datuk Mohd Zamree Mohd Ishak, and CIMB Group s co-CEO Lawrence Loh.

Mohd Zamree highlighted the longstanding relationship between CIMB and CGC, noting the successful financing of RM5.22 billion through 36 tranches since their partnership began in 2014.

    <a href="https://green-washer.com/greenwashing/2024-10-02/competition-act-changes-leave-lingering-risks-for-greenwashing-quebec-researchers-say/">Competition Act changes leave lingering risks for greenwashing , Quebec researchers say</a>
    <br/> New research from the Quebec Environmental Law Centre highlights the risks of greenwashing in Canada s climate-conscious finance and ESG sectors, despite recent changes to the federal Competition Act aimed at preventing false environmental claims. The legislation, which could impose financial penalties on companies whose green assertions fail to withstand scrutiny, leaves significant gaps in regulation, particularly in areas where compliance is mandatory.  The act s shortcomings are exacerbated by the simultaneous development of voluntary guidelines for environmental disclosure by various self-governing and regulatory organizations. This lack of a central authority has led to confusion among investors, who may be misled by inaccurate assumptions about a company s overall environmental impact.  Lead author Julien Beaulieu emphasizes the need for a unified set of mandatory standards to avoid confusion and ensure transparency. Efforts to adapt international guidelines for climate and sustainability reporting to the domestic economy are underway, and the federal government is studying a draft green and transitionary taxonomy to certify investments  environmental standards.  Mark Carney, former governor of the Bank of Canada and Bank of England, has criticized Canada s piecemeal approach to climate-related finance. The Business Council of Alberta has also expressed concerns about the legislation, warning that it could lead to years of legal judgments and restrict companies from discussing their environmental actions and aspirations.  The report recommends regulating new products and services such as voluntary carbon offsets, green and sustainability-linked bonds, and ESG ratings services. It also calls for strengthening labelling standards for investments and improved professional qualifications for financial advisers to better educate retail investors on the topic.  In conclusion, while the federal Competition Act aims to prevent greenwashing, there are still significant risks for investors due to the lack of detailed rules and regulation in Canada s climate-conscious finance and ESG sectors. A unified set of mandatory standards, improved disclosure guidelines, and enhanced professional qualifications for financial advisers are necessary to address these issues and ensure transparency in the market.

    <a href="https://green-washer.com/greenwashing/2024-10-02/cushman-minimum-wage-increases-have-been-having-highest-impact-on-office-occupancy-costs/">Cushman : Minimum wage increases have been having highest impact on office occupancy costs</a>
    <br/> The occupancy costs in Bucharest have risen by around 10% in the past two years, primarily due to increased operational costs and rent indexations amidst high inflation. The main factors influencing these operational costs include the rise in minimum wage and the return of employees to offices. Smaller office buildings have seen a more significant increase compared to larger ones, which benefit from economies of scale.  Operational costs, which are added to the rent, consist of property tax, technical maintenance, insurance, cleaning services, security, internet services, and property management. Property taxes often account for up to 50% of the total operating expenses. The increase in waste disposal, driven by higher building occupancy rates, has also contributed to the rise in operational costs.  To manage these costs effectively, the Cushman &amp; Wakefield Echinox Asset Services team has implemented measures such as monitoring and controlling utilities  consumption, ensuring efficient waste collection, and regularly assessing supplier performance. Simple methods like tracking weather forecasts, public holidays, and employee presence in the office can also help optimize costs.  By adhering to preventative maintenance schedules, long-term cost savings can be achieved by reducing repair expenses, avoiding premature equipment replacement, and minimizing tenant disruption. The company manages 14 real estate projects with a total area of over 450,000 sq. m and a market value nearing €500 million nationwide, serving 150 tenants from various industries. In Bucharest, the company oversees several iconic office buildings, with operational budgets exceeding €9.5 million.  In summary, the increase in occupancy costs in Bucharest is driven by factors such as higher minimum wage, increased office occupancy rates, and inflation. Property managers face the challenge of maintaining competitive costs while meeting tenants  needs and ensuring quality standards. The Cushman &amp; Wakefield Echinox Asset Services team has implemented various measures to optimize costs and support tenants  ESG objectives.

    <a href="https://green-washer.com/greenwashing/2024-10-02/daabon-launches-world-first-carbon-neutral-palm-oil/">DAABON Launches World First Carbon Neutral Palm Oil</a>
    <br/> DAABON UK, a subsidiary of the global sustainable agriculture leader DAABON Group, has introduced the world s first carbon-neutral organic palm oil. This innovative product not only meets the European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) but also sets a new standard for sustainability in the palm oil industry. The carbon-neutral organic palm oil has a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) CO2eq of -977kg per tonne, significantly lower than industry averages.  The palm oil, produced at DAABON s CI Tequendama SAS mill in Colombia, is certified sustainable and complies with the ISO 14067 standard. The company s commitment to sustainability is further demonstrated by its various accreditations, including RSPO, Fair Trade, Regenerative Organic Certification, Organic Certification, and Non-GMO Project.  DAABON s carbon-neutral palm oil aims to help customers reduce their Scope 3 carbon emissions and drive sustainability improvements. The company plans to replicate this achievement at its other refinery and eventually make all its palm oil carbon-negative and climate-positive.  As a signatory of The Climate Pledge, DAABON is committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. The company has also been recognized as the most transparent palm oil producer in the world by SPOTT for its Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) policies.  DAABON s carbon-neutral organic palm oil is now available, and more information can be found on their website (https://www.daabonuk.com/). The DAABON Group, founded in 1914, employs over 2,500 people and has offices across five continents.  In summary, DAABON UK s carbon-neutral organic palm oil represents a significant step forward in sustainable agriculture, setting a new standard for the industry and demonstrating the company s commitment to combating climate change and promoting sustainability.

    <a href="https://green-washer.com/greenwashing/2024-10-02/dutch-crack-down-on-cruise-industry-greenwashing/">Dutch Crack Down on Cruise Industry Greenwashing</a>
    <br/> MSC Cruises, a subsidiary of the shipping company MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company SA, has been instructed by the Dutch Advertising Code Committee to remove certain green claims from its advertisements in the Netherlands. The committee s verdict came after Dutch environmental campaigners accused the cruise operator of greenwashing. The company is now prohibited from stating that it is making progress towards net-zero emissions by 2050 and that liquefied natural gas (LNG) is a clean shipping fuel. Additionally, MSC Cruises cannot claim that passengers can  cruise responsibly or green with  the company.  The case was initiated by three Dutch action groups: Fossielvrij NL, Advocates for the Future, and Reclamejagers. Some of their concerns, such as a general restriction on cruise ads, were dismissed by the Dutch advertising body. MSC Cruises has already implemented most of the recommended changes.  This incident is part of a broader trend in Europe, where regulators are adopting a stricter approach to suspected greenwashing in various industries. In the UK, the advertising regulator took over 20 enforcement actions against greenwashing in the previous year, targeting airlines, banks, and automakers. Earlier this year, an Amsterdam court ruled that Dutch airline KLM misled customers through advertisements that falsely suggested its flights were climate-friendly.  Cruise operators have been transitioning from oil-based fuel to LNG, promoting it as a more environmentally friendly option. However, environmental activists have raised concerns that this change could have a negative short-term impact on the climate. This case highlights the growing scrutiny on green claims and the need for companies to ensure their advertising accurately reflects their environmental efforts.

    <br/> The Securities &amp; Exchange Commission (SEC) has disbanded its Climate &amp; ESG Task Force, which was established in March 2021 during the Biden administration. Despite the task force s relatively few enforcement actions over the past three-and-a-half years, it pursued high-profile cases against various entities, including asset managers and mining companies. The SEC also focused on ESG-related activities, such as greenwashing, without involving this task force.  In California, Governor Newsom s proposal to delay the implementation of recently enacted climate disclosure laws was rejected by the California Legislature. Instead, S.B. 219 was passed, granting the state agency an additional six months to adopt the regulations but not extending the compliance deadline for companies. Governor Newsom has not yet signed this legislation, and the laws are currently being challenged in court.  Recent greenwashing litigation has primarily targeted the consumer products sector. A private plaintiff filed a consumer protection lawsuit against Tyson Foods, alleging misrepresentations about  climate-smart  beef. Additionally, the SEC filed an enforcement action against a coffee machine manufacturer for false statements about the recyclability of coffee pods. These cases highlight the ongoing focus on consumer products in greenwashing litigation and suggest that more lawsuits or enforcement actions may be forthcoming against similar companies.  In summary, the SEC s disbandment of the Climate &amp; ESG Task Force may not significantly impact ESG enforcement, while California s legislative response to the climate disclosure laws and recent greenwashing litigation demonstrate the continued attention to environmental issues in the consumer products sector.

    <br/> The EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) took effect in 2024, mandating sustainability reporting by a first set of companies in 2025. The deadline for Member States to transpose the Directive into national law was July 6, 2024. However, on September 26, 2024, the European Commission (EC) adopted a package of infringement decisions for untimely transposition of certain EU Directives, including the CSRD. The EC can take legal action against EU countries that fail to implement EU law.  The CSRD, which amends the existing Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD), broadens the scope and depth of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) information that must be reported. It requires detailed disclosures on ESG impacts, risks, and opportunities. The Directive applies to large companies, small and medium enterprises, and non-EU parent companies.  The EC sent formal notice letters to 17 Member States that have not yet fully transposed the CSRD into national law, initiating the EU infringement procedure. While the EC s actions do not directly affect companies, they may expedite the CSRD implementation process in these Member States. Companies should monitor these developments as Member States might extend the scope of companies required to report under the CSRD or impose additional ESG reporting requirements.  Member States now have until November 26, 2024, to respond and complete their transposition into national law. If they fail to do so, the EC may take further steps in the infringement procedure to ensure the CSRD s implementation. Latham &amp; Watkins will continue to monitor developments relating to the CSRD and ESG reporting globally.  ENDNOTES: The EC may take legal action against EU countries that fail to implement EU law. For more information on the formal procedure, see the provided link.

    <br/> FIDO AI Ltd, a software company specializing in AI-led non-revenue water (NRW) reduction and water data insights, has secured Series B funding to scale its business. The investment round, led by CRH Ventures, the venture capital unit of CRH, a leading provider of building materials solutions, joins existing investors SKion Water GmbH, Emerald Technology Ventures, and others. The new funding will enable FIDO AI to accelerate its commercial success in global water management and corporate water stewardship, as well as pursue strategic opportunities in adjacent markets.  CRH Ventures  investment in FIDO AI aligns with CRH s focus on developing innovative and sustainable solutions for the built environment. The strategic partnership between FIDO AI and CRH is expected to position FIDO AI as a world leader in smart water resilience and stewardship across infrastructure build, maintenance, management, and sustainability reporting.  FIDO AI s unique volumetric AI technology has become a leading solution in smart water management since its development in 2019. The technology provides unparalleled data insight on hidden water leaks and is increasingly used for broader watershed level management, including proactive maintenance and collaborative corporate water replenishment programs.  FIDO AI is now used in five continents, with offices in the UK and the US. The company s AI technology can find leaks and other events on water pipeline networks in real-time and rank them by size for effective prioritization. The results are validated using volumetric water benefit accounting, a methodology for valuing water stewardship activities recognized by the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS).  Microsoft and other multinational companies are using FIDO Plus, FIDO AI s innovative corporate water stewardship model, as a key part of their global water stewardship programs. The volume of water saved through FIDO AI s technology contributes to water availability through watershed replenishment and can be claimed as a volumetric water benefit (VWB) against corporate environmental, social, and governance goals.

    <br/> Enterprise Strategy Group s research reveals that IT leaders are prioritizing generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) projects to enhance productivity and operational efficiency. Despite a 70% increase in investment over the past year, less than 10% of IT decision-makers have deployed GenAI in live environments, with only 8% in mature production. However, there has been a significant rise in early production (36%) and pilot projects (22%), indicating that over a quarter of IT executives are involved in GenAI initiatives.  The IT department is the primary beneficiary of AI deployments, with GenAI being used in an average of 3.5 application areas. Software development is the top application, with 41% of respondents utilizing GenAI for tasks such as test script generation, troubleshooting, code reviews, and documentation. PwC has identified additional use cases, including automatic generation of user stories, acceptance criteria, test cases, and APIs.  Other areas experiencing increased GenAI usage include research, IT operations (7% growth), and cybersecurity (6% growth). AI-driven automation is being employed to optimize cloud operations and enhance customer experiences, while GenAI s pattern recognition and natural language processing capabilities are being leveraged to strengthen cybersecurity defenses.  Organizations with mature AI deployments are more likely to use GenAI for software development, IT operations, and finance. The survey also highlights the importance of using internal data to support GenAI initiatives, as 84% of IT leaders believe it is crucial for their organization to train its own models. Two-thirds of IT leaders use multiple LLMs for GenAI deployment, with 9% using five or more.  In conclusion, while GenAI adoption is still in its early stages, IT leaders are recognizing its potential to improve productivity and operational efficiency. The focus is shifting towards early production and pilot projects, with a growing emphasis on using internal data to train customized GenAI models. This trend is expected to continue as organizations seek to harness the power of AI to drive innovation and enhance their competitive advantage.

    <br/> Angelina Jolie announced a bipartisan update to the Violence Against Women Act at a news conference on Feb. 9, 2022. The Bentley-Gallup Business in Society Survey highlights the challenges businesses face in being socially responsible amidst a polarized political climate. The survey reveals varied public expectations on societal issues, with a majority desiring businesses to take a stand on climate change, diversity, equity, and mental health. However, businesses are cautious about alienating stakeholders and are hesitant to publicly endorse their initiatives.  The survey also notes a decline in social progress in countries like the U.S., UK, Syria, and Venezuela. Despite this, businesses have the potential to be a force for good, with clear priorities from employees and consumers, such as ethical practices, quality healthcare benefits, mental health support, and flexible work arrangements.  To navigate this complex landscape, businesses can focus on the social issues most important to their stakeholders, engage in  Lobbying for Good  to influence legal and regulatory contexts, and create opportunities for citizen engagement in co-creating solutions to social challenges.  The report suggests that business leaders should ask questions, listen, and learn to determine a strategy. It emphasizes the importance of commitment to change beyond superficial measures, as businesses have the power to make a significant impact on societal issues. The future of corporate social responsibility lies in seizing the opportunity to address the concerns of employees and consumers, rather than reverting to a narrow focus on profit and legal compliance.
