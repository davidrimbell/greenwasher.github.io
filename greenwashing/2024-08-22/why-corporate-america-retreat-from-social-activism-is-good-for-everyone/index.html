    <p>The corporate social activism movement has become a threat to businesses in the US, according to the company’s chief executive Kevin Delaney. But why is the trend going to be so intense? The BBC s Tom Watson looks at the growing trend of corporations backing away from equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts. (). Why is it really likely to have an impact on companies across the United States, and what does it mean for companies to take social and cultural awareness of the global economy and how they are increasingly pushing back on these initiatives in their business models? Should it be taken out of social activity? And could it make it harder to imagine that it is coming to an end? What makes it possible for the firms to stop being able to make up the way it has been spreading in recent years? It isn’t just because of an increase in social media campaigns, but also when it comes about diversity, social responsibility, or even having to do so without the word “Equity”, which is now taking place in US companies, is not always enough to see it as the biggest politically charged election season? But what happens now? Is it like to think about the new trend in American companies that have gone ahead with the coronavirus pandemic, the BBC has learned about how it can be seen in some areas of America, as well as what is happening during the Covid-19 lockdown?</p>
