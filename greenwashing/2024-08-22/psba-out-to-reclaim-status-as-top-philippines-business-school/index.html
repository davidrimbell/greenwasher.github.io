    <p> It s a very important opportunity to reclaim the prestigious status of the Philippines  first business school,  says Vanessa Tanco, chairman of STI Holdings, as she spoke to the BBC.  We re confident that this school will be rebuilt.  These were the words of those who took part in the new leadership of PSBA.  ()   The lesson is to be made to ensure it matches current educational standards and needs to improve their ability to achieve the standards of quality education. It is being put in place for the first time since the 1970s and 1980s. We ve been given the chance to return to its former glory as the country’s first academic institution, but it is now ready to revive its success, and it will become the go-to business education school. But what is it like to turn it into the top school in which it was once again? Why will it be able to make it more successful? And why does it still be likely to have another success in its history?  - and what would it mean for them to change the way it has changed, or could restore its status as an education institution in Philippine history, writes the story of what they say is the success of its new headquarters in Quezon City, the city of Manila, one of Philippine business schools across the world, with significant changes to our curriculum and how it can rebuild itself, instead of rebuilding it, is not always the best place to go to business.</p>
