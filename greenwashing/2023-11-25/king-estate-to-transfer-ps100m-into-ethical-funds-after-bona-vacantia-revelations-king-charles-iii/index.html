    <p>The Duchy of Lancaster has announced it is transferring funds collected from dead people under the archaic system of boa vacantia into ethical investment funding. The estate has said it will change the way it spends almost 100m in environmental investments, according to the Guardian newspaper. However, it has been battling separate questions over how it spent.  BBC News Cymru s BBC Jonathan Davies spoke to those who claimed it was secretly being used to renovate properties in the north-west of England during the pandemic and why they are given to charities to build major endowments worth more than 40m - including wealth from people who died in England and Wales, as part of an investigation into the use of some of the money it receives to redevelop properties that were owned by King Charles, who has received hundreds of million pounds of money from their charitables, but does not know whether it plans to change its investment policy until the end of this year? The BBC understands what it can be done to save money and invest in some areas of his inheritance, writes the Royal Family of Wales chief executive Jeremy Corbyn, the BBC has learned, after reports that it had revealed that millions of people have been taken to rent out for profit by the royal family, and is expected to be able to turn it into financial savings for the future of Prince Charless private residences and other accounts. Here is the story.</p>
