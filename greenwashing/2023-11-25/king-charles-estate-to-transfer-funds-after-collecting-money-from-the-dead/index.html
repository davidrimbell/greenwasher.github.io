    <p>The Duchy of Lancaster has announced it is transferring its investment portfolio into ethical, social or environmental funds, amid a row over the use of the monarch to renovate properties owned by the kings heir-to-the-throne inherited by his son, Prince Charles, who died without their will or next of his wife.. But The Duke of Cornwall has confirmed it will be transferred to investments in political and economic benefits, the BBC has learned, after reports revealed that the royal estate has been using the concept of bona vacantia to revive properties of people who were killed by King Charles to redevelop properties in England and Wales which it claimed to be linked to the Royal Family, but says it wants to change the way it invests in public and historic properties, as it moves the process to transfer it into investment accounts for those who are being treated as illegally wealthy, and it has said it plans to cease collecting money from charities that have been used to invest in private property and mining companies during the pandemic, in an attempt to save millions of lives in the UK, with an admission of unethical investing schemes that appear to have failed to make it more profitable than any other royal family, writes The Guardian newspaper on Friday, saying it was planning to turn its financial fortunes into social and social donations for the Prince of Wales and his family. Why is it not going to take action?</p>
