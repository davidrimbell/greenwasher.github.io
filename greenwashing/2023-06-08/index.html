  <meta name="description" content="Investment in funds that oppose ESG (environmental, social, and governance) principles peaked in Q3 2021 at $376 million.

Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) has started releasing irradiated seawater into an underwater tunnel to dispose of contaminated water from the Fukushima nuclear disaster. The process was done secretly due to protests. The tunnel will guide the water 1 kilometer offshore. The release system is almost complete, with only a reservoir remaining. The water has been used to cool damaged reactor cores since the disaster.
In conclusion, some companies face accusations of greenwashing while others, like Fortune Brands Innovations and VMware, are making progress in incorporating ESG practices. Fidelity Bank is committed to sustainability, and investors should consider their own values and preferences. Transparency and accountability are crucial, as seen in the backlash against Tokyo Electric Power Company&rsquo;s secretive actions.
