    <p>The chief financial officer of the British Chambers of Commerce, Richard Branson, has told the BBC that a high quality equity approach is important to maintain their portfolios and avoid the permanent destruction of capital. The BBC s weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world, including the UK, France and the US and Canada..
