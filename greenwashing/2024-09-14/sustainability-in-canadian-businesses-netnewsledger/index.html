    <p> Canadian businesses are increasingly prioritizing sustainability, with companies like Wajax leading the way in integrating sustainability into their operations. Cristian Rodriguez, Vice President of Safety, Sustainability, and People at Wajax, acknowledges that Canada has historically lagged behind the EU and the USA in sustainability disclosures but is now catching up. The company has expanded its sustainability team over the past decade, including roles focused on wellness and employee well-being.  Rodriguez highlights the positive trends in corporate responsibility and sustainability in Canada, such as the release of proposed Canadian Sustainability Disclosure Standards and the clean power and low carbon fuels sector s success. He also notes the job market boom in sustainability-related roles, driven by increased investment in sustainable practices.  Despite progress, Rodriguez emphasizes that Canadian companies still face challenges in meeting sustainability benchmarks. The UN s Sustainable Development Goals show that only 15% are on track for 2030, and there is a need for a broader understanding of sustainability beyond carbon footprints.  To address these challenges, Rodriguez suggests that Canadian businesses focus on gender equality, climate action, living wages, water resilience, and finance and investment in sustainability. He also warns of potential consequences for companies that neglect sustainability, including governmental policy changes and amendments targeting greenwashing.  Rodriguez encourages Canadian businesses to continue challenging the status quo and to seek support from sustainability professionals, NGOs, and consultants. He highlights resources like Eco Canada, which offers partnerships, programs, and research to support employers and practitioners in the environmental sector.  In summary, Canadian businesses are making strides in sustainability, but there is still significant room for improvement. Companies must address material issues to stakeholders, invest in employee well-being, and focus on key areas of action to make a substantial impact. By doing so, they can protect the planet and their own long-term success.</p>
