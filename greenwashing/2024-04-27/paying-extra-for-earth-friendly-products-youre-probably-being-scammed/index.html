    <p>A court in Australia has ruled that a picnicware labelled as eco-friendly has been rejected by the Australian Environmental Protection Commission (ACCC) because it was not suitable for composting. The BBC s Stephanie Hegarty looks at why the case doesnt be illegal. Why is the ACCC losing the legal battle against the BBC. What is it actually really important for businesses to hide the  green truth  - and what is going to be done to tackle environmental claims that they are not misleading customers? Should we change our consumer laws? The Supreme Court has told us about the issue of climate change, which makes it harder to prove that it is unfair to make it clearer and more accurately explains how their products are being treated as sustainable and environmentally harmful when it comes to the environment, and how it can be tackled by scientists, journalists and business leaders? What could we learn from new rules and ways to change the way we use these false declarations? And what would we do to stop those claiming that one of Australias biggest consumers should be banned from using the word eco or greener without having to do so? Here is what we need to know from the new consumer law, as well as how we can make the difference between the good options and the harms of other parts of our business? How should we take action to prevent dangerous chemicals in the country?</p>
