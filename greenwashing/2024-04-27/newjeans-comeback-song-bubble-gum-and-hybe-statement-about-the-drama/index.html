    <p>NewJeans have revealed their comeback single, Bubble Gum, after a whistleblowing email which claimed the singer was not enough to promote her as the first girl group in the UKs financial giant, Hybe, has been released by the BBC.

()  How is it going to be the subject of an investigation into claims that the group is being investigated for the second time since the start of the scandal, but what has happened to the new group when it launched an audit of its management rights? The BBC s Newsnight looks at the controversy over the alleged takeover of environmental agency Environmental Protection Agency (HYBE) has not been posted on social media?
