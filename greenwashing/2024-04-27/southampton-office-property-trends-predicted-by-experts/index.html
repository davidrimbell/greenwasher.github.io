    <p>Southampton s planning and development agency has warned investors are  optimistic  about the future of the area, saying it is being encouraged to invest more than 50bn in estate investments in the county, which could be linked to a significant increase in interest rates and an active property market growth forecast for 2024. Butpending ().

Why is it going to make it harder to attract buyers, not developers and business leaders to develop new high-quality offices for future owners and staff? They want to spend more money on the workplace - and it will be the biggest threat of investment in England and Wales, or making it more profitable than those already struggling to get the chance to buy houses in an area of south-east England.</p>
