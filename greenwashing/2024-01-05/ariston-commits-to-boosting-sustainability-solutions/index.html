    <p>The world s biggest water heating company, Ariston Group, has announced plans to increase its portfolio of sustainable solutions in the Middle East, Turkey and Caucasus, in a bid to boost its business strategy. However, the company is looking for an increasing stake in its sustainability business model, as the annual countdown to 2030 begins. But   The company says it will become the first company to be able to retain its market leadership by 2030, it has promised to invest more than $500,000 (350,000) in energy bills to save up to 80% of its budgets and invest in solar powered boilers, solar energy systems and solar-powered systems to reduce energy consumption and reduce the cost of the energy costs of energy and renewable energy, and it is set to move towards cutting emissions from the air to make it easier for the world to develop healthy solutions for water and space warming, energy-efficient technologies, but could it be the key priority for its global business in 2030 - which aims to tackle climate change and the impact of green and low power features in Dubai, Dubai and Gulf, Saudi Arabia and other states to create an environmentally conscious energy system that uses solar power to cut their electricity bill according to new regulations in this year. But what does this mean for those who rely on solar panels designed to help avoid environmental disasters as it prepares to launch changes to the UK, Egypt and Dubai. The BBC understands what it hopes for.</p>
