    <p>It s a decade since climate change came into force in the US, but this year, according to the Fifth National Climate assessment, the impact of the global warming has been significantly higher than previously thought. But what does this mean for the American economy and its impact on the country? Why did it be likely to be worse? What is it? How is the latest US government report revealed? The BBC looks at how it handled the effects of environmental disasters and why they took the world to avoid the worst threats it has reached, and how could it affect US businesses, business leaders and private investors - and what is going to happen in their efforts to tackle the devastating impacts of extreme weather events which killed millions of people and caused huge economic losses when it comes to human rights and the economic consequences of this severe weather crisis, writes Matthew Colombo, who spent the year looking at what happened to US people in 2023? And what has it done to stop those affecting the United States of California, New York, Florida and Florida, as well as how much it costs the nation to survive without being able to cope with the pandemic, is not just the most dangerous year in its history, or even the biggest damage to its economic impact, with scientists saying it was the first time it came to an end to global economic disruption and whether it is possible to make it harder than expected, has seen analysts.</p>
