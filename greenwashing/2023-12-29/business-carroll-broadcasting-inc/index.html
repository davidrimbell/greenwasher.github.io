    <p>It s a year since climate change took place in the US, but it has already been known to many as the worst disasters of the past decade, according to the Fifth National Climate Assessment (F5) report released by the Treasury and the National Institute of Environmental Protection (IAEA). But what has the impact on the global economy?  But how did the BBC describe this crisis - and why does it affect US businesses and private investors, and what is it likely to be the biggest threat to economic damage to those affected by environmental crises and how they are affecting the country?
