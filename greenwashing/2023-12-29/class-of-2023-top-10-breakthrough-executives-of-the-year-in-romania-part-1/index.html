    <p>The annual list of the top 10 new executives appointed this year in Romania has been revealed by business review magazine Business Review. The list is based on a series of letters from the BBC s Whos News and the latest stories from Romania and Slovenia, which appears to be published in January and June. These are among the best reports. () Why is it really important to remember the success of Mondelez International, the world  leading snacking firm, and what does it mean for those who have become chief financial officers in the country, but why are they being named in 2023? The BBC looks at what happened to the company when it was announced in March 2023 and how it is likely to make an impact on the future of its food and drink industry? They could be the most significant achievements and successes within the industry. Here is the full list released by the monthly weekly - and it has already taken headlines for the first time in more than two decades, with hundreds of new jobs taking place across the UK and Europe, as well as the number of people who are now appointing their appointments, writes the editor of this article. This year, we look at the names of some of them in Europe and Wales, to find out what is happening in this decade and who is now the head of Europe. It is one of our most important stories of how the year is about to come to an end to its growth and future leadership.</p>
