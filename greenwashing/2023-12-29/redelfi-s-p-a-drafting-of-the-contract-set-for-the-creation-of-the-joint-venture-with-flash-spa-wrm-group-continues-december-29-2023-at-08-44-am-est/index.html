    <p>Redelfi S.p.A. and Flash SPA have extended the term sheet until January 31, 2024 - the first time they signed a contract set aimed at regulating what has been agreed between the two firms in the early financial phase of their contracts. Financial results are expected to be released on the website of the company s BBC. () Here is what is it known as the  Redelfi  announcement by the Italian investor- relations agency, ISSuar, in which it has revealed that the contract is being drafted to ensure further agreements have been reached during the definition of energy and digital transition in Italy, and could be regulated by another joint venture worth  4.2m (2.1m) within the next three years. The terms of contract length will remain longer than previously announced in Milan, 29 December 2023, as part of an effort to protect the firm from the coronavirus pandemic, but it is not guaranteed that it will continue to work on renewable energy infrastructure projects across the country, the BBC has learned. Here are the details of what happened in its latest press release on Wednesday. This is the full-yearly report published in Italian newspapers and online broadcasts following the Covid-19 crisis in Europe and Europe, on Tuesday, 17 December. It is now ready to begin ahead of this year. A briefing has begun on how the terms are set to change when it comes to the end of next year.</p>
