    <p>The world s biggest social impact firm has been named on a list of US companies for the third consecutive year, the New York Times has revealed, ahead of its annual Excellence 1000 Index - which highlights the commitment to powering social responsibility and ethical standards in business and financial growth across the world, and in the US. But  The BBC Newsweek has found that the company is among the most powerful companies on the list, but it is also being given the title of the top 100 companies in their list for 2024, as it looks at efforts to promote diversity and the impact of human rights in US businesses and individuals, to help communities and other industries to achieve higher levels of corporate leadership. The US company says it has made significant progress against its  social impact  targets in its work to tackle the global philanthropic effort to fight climate change and protecting the environment and helping people to get more responsible. But what is it likely to be the first such achievements when it comes to the technology giant, Blackbaud? Why has it been awarded this year recognition? The latest report from the BBC has heard about how it worked to boost society and improve transparency in global economy and its impacts and how they are taking steps towards increasing environmental equality and supporting its success during the coronavirus pandemic and coronavirus lockdown restrictions in America. These are the key areas behind the new awards.</p>
