    <p>Companies are increasingly tapping into the growing field of observability, which means they need more intelligence to monitor their networks and applications. Why is it so sought-after and why does it help businesses meet those needs? The BBC s Larry Madowo looks at how it is being treated in a series of reports. () What is the way it can be done to tackle these challenges, and how could it be used to help companies cope with the rapid rise in cybersecurity and cyber security threats and what is happening in the cloud-based world of cyber-security, writes the BBC’s Steve Ballmer, who has been talking about the future of the technology giant - and who is on the front line of its latest acquisition of Splunk and New relic? When it comes to surveillance, it has become the most sophisticated technology in recent years, but what makes it really becoming the biggest challenge for IT teams to meet the demands of vigilance and control of users and apps? It is not always enough to be able to detect and detect anomalies that affect productivity and security? This is what happens for the firms that are now struggling to find out when it gets out of control and access to the data and other sensitive issues during the pandemic, asks BBC Newsnight. The chief executive of Microsoft, Mark Zuckerberg, has found that it will be more likely to take advantage of such efforts to achieve significant changes.</p>
