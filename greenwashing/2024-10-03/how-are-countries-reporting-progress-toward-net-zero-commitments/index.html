  <meta name="title" content="How Are Countries Reporting Progress Toward Net - Zero Commitments ? "/>
  <meta name="description" content=" Countries are increasingly setting political and policy commitments to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with many aiming for this goal by 2050. To track progress toward these commitments, it is crucial for governments to monitor, assess, and report on their advancements. This process not only aids in improving planning but also promotes accountability, transparency, and trust among stakeholders.  The World Resources Institute (WRI) reviewed various net-zero reporting methodologies and national processes to understand how countries can report on their progress. The assessment highlighted the need for clear definitions of net-zero targets, including scope and legal status, and the importance of monitoring sector-specific actions and cross-cutting enabling actions. These actions encompass finance, governance, stakeholder engagement, carbon dioxide removal, and just transition.  Different methodologies and frameworks have been established by organizations to assess net-zero progress. These frameworks often track both sectoral and enabling actions using an indicator-based approach. Transparent reporting on carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is also crucial, with countries needing to specify targets for emission reductions and removals, and provide methodologies and assumptions in line with the Paris Agreement.  Countries are not required to report on net-zero progress under the Paris Agreement, leading to a variety of national reporting practices. For example, Canada has a reporting process outlined in the Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act, Chile has decentralized net-zero implementation across several government agencies, and the United Kingdom has detailed plans for meeting carbon budgets.  To report internationally on their net-zero progress, countries can use the Paris Agreement s Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF). This includes reporting on policies and measures, projections for future GHG emissions, and tracking progress made in implementing and achieving Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).  To enhance understanding and advance good practices for assessing progress, further research, dialogue, and capacity building are needed. Countries with net-zero targets but without a defined tracking system can learn from their peers and establish relevant processes for institutionalizing reporting.
