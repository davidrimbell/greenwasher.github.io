  <meta name="description" content=" The UN Global Compact Network Australia (UNGCNA) is convening a high-profile event, UNiting Business LIVE Australia: Sustainability in Action, to encourage Australian business leaders to prioritize sustainability. The event, featuring key figures like Kate Dundas and Sanda Ojiambo, aims to inspire and provide actionable advice for integrating sustainability into business strategies.  Dundas emphasizes the need for systems-wide change and highlights the missed opportunities for Australian businesses to align profit with purpose. The event will cover various themes, including leveraging First Nations knowledge for environmental protection, sustainable growth, and the use of AI for sustainability.  Ojiambo stresses the private sector s crucial role in addressing sustainability challenges, including environmental and social issues. The event will focus on progressing the Australian sustainable business agenda through the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact.  The conference, taking place at Doltone House in Sydney, aims to drive a positive impact on the industry, ecosystem, and planet. It is open to all business and sustainability leaders who wish to contribute to a more sustainable and profitable future for corporate Australia.  The event is part of the UNGCNA s efforts to help businesses keep environmental and social sustainability at the forefront, aligning with the UN s Sustainable Development Goals. It also addresses the upcoming mandatory climate-related financial reporting in Australia, urging businesses to future-proof and integrate ESG principles into their operations.
