The SET50, SET100, and SETTRI indices also showed negative changes.  The global market is experiencing mixed signals of economic recovery, with advanced economies showing stronger rebound compared to emerging markets facing inflation and geopolitical tensions. Inflation remains a concern, prompting central banks to adjust monetary policies.  Sustainability and ESG investments are gaining momentum, with companies demonstrating commitment to sustainability attracting interest from ethical investors and experiencing improved performance. The shift towards sustainability is creating opportunities in green technology sectors.  Digital transformation is accelerating across industries, with e-commerce thriving and businesses investing in digital platforms and cybersecurity. The tech sector remains robust, driven by innovations in artificial intelligence, fintech, and cloud computing.  Geopolitical tensions and supply chain disruptions have become significant concerns for investors, leading companies to reassess their dependency on global suppliers and prioritize supply chain resilience through onshoring and regional partnerships.
