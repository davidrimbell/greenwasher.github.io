  <meta name="title" content="Google CEO Eyes Atomic Power For AI Data Centers As Big Tech Seeks Nuclear Revival To Achieve Net Zero"/>
  <meta name="description" content=" Google CEO Sundar Pichai revealed in an interview that the tech giant is considering nuclear energy as a potential  green  source to power its AI data centers. This comes amidst the company s ambitious goal to achieve net-zero emissions by 2030, despite a significant increase in power consumption and greenhouse gas emissions due to the proliferation of AI data centers.  Pichai acknowledged the challenge of meeting the net-zero emissions target, especially with the scale of AI investments. To address this, Google is exploring additional investments in green energy, such as solar, and evaluating technologies like small modular nuclear reactors.  The company s interest in nuclear energy is not unique, as other tech giants like Microsoft have also signed power agreements with dormant nuclear power plants, such as Three Mile Island. Moreover, the Biden administration has closed a $1.52 billion loan with Holtec s Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan to revive it.  The funding markets are becoming more receptive to nuclear deals as governments and big tech recognize the importance of nuclear power in achieving ambitious net-zero goals. In December 2020, a note titled  Buy Uranium: Is This The Beginning Of The Next ESG Craze?  highlighted the increasing interest in uranium prices, which are expected to rise steadily over time.  In summary, Google is considering nuclear energy as a potential  green  source to power its AI data centers, joining other tech giants in exploring this option to meet their net-zero emissions targets. The funding markets are also showing growing interest in nuclear deals, as governments and big tech understand the crucial role of nuclear power in achieving ambitious climate goals."/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://green-washer.com/greenwashing/2024-10-03/google-ceo-eyes-atomic-power-for-ai-data-centers-as-big-tech-seeks-nuclear-revival-to-achieve-net-zero/">
