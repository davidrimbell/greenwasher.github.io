  <meta name="description" content=" Google has entered into a 12-year power purchase agreement with energyRe, a leading independent energy company, to acquire renewable energy from a 435-megawatt (MWdc) solar project. The solar project, which will be developed, owned, and operated by energyRe, aims to supply electricity and Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) to Google, enabling the tech giant to power over 56,000 homes. This agreement aligns with Google s ambitious goal to achieve 24/7 carbon-free energy across all grids where the company operates by 2030.  The deal was facilitated through LEAPtm, a platform co-developed by Google and LevelTen Energy, designed to streamline the process of clean energy buying and selling. Amanda Peterson Corio, Google s Global Head of Data Center Energy, highlighted the company s commitment to accelerating the delivery of new clean power to the grid.  Miguel Prado, CEO of energyRe, expressed pride in delivering reliable clean power to support Google s sustainability and decarbonization objectives. He emphasized that energyRe s proven track record in providing clean energy solutions makes it a trusted partner for companies striving to reduce their carbon footprints.  Nationally, energyRe s onshore utility-scale portfolio includes 1,520 MWdc of contracted solar assets and 398 megawatt-hours (MWh) of contracted battery storage assets. The company, which has offices in New York, Houston, Indianapolis, and Charleston, is dedicated to addressing complex sustainability challenges and offering clean energy solutions in various sectors, including transmission, onshore wind, solar, offshore wind, energy storage, and distributed generation.  This partnership between Google and energyRe represents a significant step towards a more sustainable future, as both companies work together to achieve their respective goals of carbon neutrality and clean energy production. The agreement was announced on October 3, 2024, and distributed by PRNewswire.
