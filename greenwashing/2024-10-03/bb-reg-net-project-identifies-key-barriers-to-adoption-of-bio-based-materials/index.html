  <meta name="description" content=" The Bio-based and Biodegradable Materials Regulatory Network (BB-REG-NET) project, funded by Innovate UK and led by various industry and academic partners, has identified key barriers to the widespread adoption of bio-based, biodegradable, and compostable materials (BB-materials). The study, which involved extensive literature review, stakeholder engagement, and research, highlighted several challenges:  1. High costs: Bio-based materials are more expensive due to higher feedstock costs and new technology requirements. Traditional fossil-fuel industries also benefit from subsidies, putting BB-materials at a disadvantage. 2. Regulatory hurdles: UK policy lacks cohesion, favoring fossil-based plastics. 3. Performance limitations: Inconsistent durability, limited shelf life, and difficulty achieving specific properties like heat resistance hinder the adoption of BB-materials. 4. Infrastructure gaps: The UK s recycling and composting infrastructure is not equipped to handle BB-materials, leading to contamination risks. 5. Consumer confusion: Low public awareness and misunderstanding of terms like  biodegradable  contribute to greenwashing campaigns.  To address these challenges, the study suggests targeted interventions, including policy support, consumer education, and sustainable alternatives. Policy support involves developing a unified bioeconomy strategy with clear regulations and standardized certification to allow BB-materials to compete fairly with fossil-based products. Consumer education and well-crafted communications strategies are recommended to ensure correct use and disposal of BB-materials.  The study also emphasizes the positive benefits of BB-materials, such as reducing dependence on fossil fuels, cutting greenhouse gas emissions, stimulating job creation, and supporting farmers with non-food-based income streams. With the UK chemical sector aiming to source 80% of its carbon needs from non-virgin fossil sources by 2050, BB-materials are expected to cover 30% of this sustainable carbon.
