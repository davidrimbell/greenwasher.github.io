  <meta name="description" content=" Starburst, an open data lakehouse company, has appointed Steve Williamson as SVP and General Manager to lead its growth in the EMEA region. The company aims to address the increasing demand for AI and ML technologies in the area by offering hybrid solutions that enable secure and efficient access to enterprise data across on-premises and cloud IT environments.  Steve Williamson brings over 20 years of experience in technology leadership, having previously served as General Manager of EMEA at Apptio and held executive roles at Acquia, Demandware/Salesforce, DELL/EMC, and Oracle. His expertise in delivering innovative technology to EMEA customers will be instrumental in Starburst s expansion plans.  Starburst s platform, Trino and Apache Iceberg (also known as  Icehouse ), simplifies access to enterprise data in both on-premises and cloud architectures. This enables European enterprises to navigate challenges in data privacy, security, and compliance while meeting the dynamic needs of the market. The company s goal is to help its customers accelerate their AI, ML, and analytics capabilities, ultimately driving faster revenue growth and lower costs while mitigating data risks.  Starburst is the leading end-to-end data platform that empowers data-intensive and security-conscious organizations, such as Comcast, Halliburton, Vectra, EMIS Health, and 7 of the top 10 global banks, to democratize data access, enhance analytics performance, and improve architecture optionality. With the Open Hybrid Lakehouse from Starburst, enterprises globally can easily discover and use all their data to power AI and other business-critical applications like anti-money laundering and fraud analytics, next best products, customer 360, log analytics, and ESG reporting.
