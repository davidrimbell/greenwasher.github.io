    <p>India s financial markets have reported a significant increase in institutional investments during the first three months of the year, marking the highest annual growth since the 2020 slump in investment in the country earlier this year. However, the industry is expected to remain unbeaten by foreign investors, with higher levels of investment. But    says the UK economy is now struggling to cope with an increasing appetite for overseas businesses, as the world braces for the future of Indian housing and residential sectors, and the US could become the second country in its growing economic presence - and it is likely to continue to be able to retain their dominance until 2024, it has been revealed by business giant Colliers India has released evidence of rising interest in domestic buildings, offices and data centres. The latest figures have shown that the sector has rebounded ahead of next year when it closes to the end of 2020, but experts say they are looking at the prospects of its resilience, despite uncertainty in global and domestic capital, in particular those in Asia and Asia, say analysts from the Asia-Pacific region which appear to have seen an unprecedented rise in influx of more than 5% of all the global places. But according to business leaders, there are no signs of recession and economic recovery in India following the coronavirus pandemic, writes the BBC News Marathi.</p>
