    <p>Climate change is a major challenge for judges in the US, but what does it mean for the country s justice system and how it is affected by the climate change crisis, according to new research. Why is it likely to become the biggest threat to human rights and the future of the global warming? Environmental Law Institute (CJP)  () How is the process of legal action to tackle the impact of environmental laws in US courts and cities across the world to be able to respond to the pandemic? The BBC looks at how they are being encouraged to take advantage of an increasing amount of information about the dangers of air pollution? What could it be done to protect those who are preparing for high-profile litigation against the polluted oil industry and its impact on their ability to deal with the risks it has reached when it comes to air strikes, writes Michael Madden, who has been involved in its efforts to help them avoid severe damages by scientists? And why is there growing evidence that some of them are not going to do so - and what is happening in cases related to it, and who is on the top of its kind of role in legal challenges during the coronavirus lockdown, as it makes it harder to get the right to know how to handle the problem? It is not just the most dangerous political crises that causes global disruption, or even the effects of it?</p>
