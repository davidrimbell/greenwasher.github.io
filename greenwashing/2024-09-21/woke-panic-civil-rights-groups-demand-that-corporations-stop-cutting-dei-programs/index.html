    <p> The woke ideology and DEI policies, which had been covertly infiltrating American institutions for decades, became overtly prominent in the mid-2010s. Establishment-controlled NGOs like the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations, as well as George Soros  Open Society Foundation, invested billions into US universities to influence the professional class with social justice programs and propagandists. The goal was to create a progressive trickle-down effect in major corporate and political institutions, but this strategy failed.  The woke movement s decline began as Big Tech companies like Meta and Google cut DEI staff and resources in 2023, and major corporations started abandoning their DEI initiatives in 2024. The Hollywood Reporter highlighted the fall of DEI in Hollywood, while gay activist group GLAAD noted a decline in LGBT representation in popular entertainment.  Three reasons contributed to the collapse of DEI programs:  1. The end of QE programs and interest rate hikes led to a drying up of ESG money, causing venture capital to disappear and forcing woke companies to rely on profits. 2. The mass boycotting of woke companies demonstrated that there was no market for products catering to DEI. 3. Lawsuits over DEI hiring practices revealed an element of ant-white and anti-straight prejudice, leading companies to fear backlash in civil courts and financial disaster from hiring poorly qualified employees to check diversity boxes.  Consumers and the free market rejected DEI, and boycotts of products like Bud Light and Star Wars: The Acolyte proved the political left s lack of power. Leftists attempted to maintain DEI programs despite public refusal, but their efforts were undermined by the fact that shareholders were tired of losing money.  In response, civil rights organizations like the NAACP and the National Organization for Women pressured companies to keep DEI departments in place, claiming that abandoning them would alienate consumers. However, the opposite was true, as DEI propaganda and hiring practices had degraded company performance and politicized consumer markets.  In conclusion</p>
