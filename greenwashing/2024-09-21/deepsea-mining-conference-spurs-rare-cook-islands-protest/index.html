    <p> Civil society groups in the Cook Islands have voiced concerns over the increasing involvement of seabed mineral companies in the nation, despite the potential economic benefits. The country, known for its pristine beaches and small population of 15,000, is hosting a conference on underwater minerals, signaling its interest in deepsea mining. However, not everyone is convinced that exploiting seabed resources, such as manganese and cobalt, is a wise decision.  A demonstration in Avarua Harbour, featuring traditional vessels and a large sign reading  Protect Our Ocean, #Think Deeply,  was organized by three civil society organizations to show opposition to deepsea mining. They argue that the seafloor around the Cook Islands is rich in polymetallic nodules, which could potentially add billions to the economy if mined. However, skeptics warn that mining could cause irreparable damage to an environment that is still poorly understood.  The Cook Islands  government has issued exploration licenses to three seabed mining companies, but has not yet announced if or when mining will begin. Some Pacific island neighbors, like Nauru, are also interested in exploiting resources in international waters.  Despite the potential economic benefits, Cook Islanders are concerned about the long-term impact of deepsea mining on their country s wealth and well-being. The country s tourism-reliant economy suffered during the COVID-19 pandemic, and leaders worry about remaining poor for the rest of their lives.  Civil society organizations have expressed concerns about how deepsea mining companies have embedded themselves into Cook Island society, funding charitable trusts and sponsoring cultural events. They accuse these companies of  greenwashing  efforts to raise awareness about seabed minerals.  In conclusion, while the Cook Islands is exploring the potential economic benefits of deepsea mining, there is significant opposition from civil society groups and some local leaders. They argue that more time is needed for research and discussion on the potential risks and threats to the environment and the country s long-term prosperity.</p>
