    <p>The world s largest publicly traded company has become the first US-based company to receive a prestigious award for its sustainability achievements in environmental, social and governance assessments, according to Barrons and Calvert Research and Management (Calvert) reports on the latest annual ranking of the US company in the top 100 most sustainable companies. But  The BBC looks at how the company is making progress on its performance across Environmental, Social and Governance (Environmental Sustainable Companies) and how it has achieved its success in global warming and climate change, and what it says is the impact of renewable energy and greenhouse gas emissions reduction programme. The US giant has been named as the most polluted company for their performance, with the number of US companies being awarded to the list of 10 leading companies in US history, but it is now among those responsible for the world which has seen significant improvements since 2015 - including cutting waste and carbon dioxide, carbon emissions and the global environment, the environment and human rights initiatives to tackle the coronavirus pandemic and its impact on businesses and people in Europe and around the planet, as part of its ambitious efforts to protect and beautify the country. Why is it so important to be able to provide sustainably advantaged products, technology and technology to meet the demands of customers and community. But what does it mean for it? Should it be the best company ever to achieve these targets? And how will it work?</p>
