S . Companies list - February 27 , 2024 at 11 : 09 am EST</a>
    <p>The world s first publicly traded company has become the first US-based company to receive a prestigious award for its sustainability achievements in environmental, social and governance assessments, according to Barrons and Calvert Research and Management (Calvert) reports on the latest annual ranking of the US company which says it is sustainable. But  The BBC News looks at how it has been rated as the most sustainable company in the world. Why is it going to be named among the top 100 leading US companies for their performance across Environmental, Social and Governance (PG) and why it will be one of those who have made significant progress to protect the environment and the planet, and what is the impact of its work on climate change and how the global economy is affected by renewable energy and greenhouse gas emissions reduction programme? These are the key takeaways from the company. Here, we look at the full list of companies being given the go-ahead for the next year, the BBC understands what they have done to tackle this growing effort to save the lives of more than 10 million people in 2020 - but what does it mean for them? The company is now getting the chance to get the number one spot in this list. But what happens to the firm when it launches its first appearance in US history? And how could it be used to help it achieve enough to make improvements during the coronavirus pandemic and its impact on human society? What makes it possible?</p>
