    <p>A mixed-use development company in the Philippines has been named as the country s best-known developer at a prestigious property awards ceremony in Manila, the capital city of Davao, on Sunday. They have been awarded the highest prize for their work and dedication to delivering outstanding developments, including residential, commercial and recreational projects.  The BBC looks at what happened to Eton Properties, one of the worlds most successful properties, and why it has become the first country to receive the top grades of its ability to create communities that merge between urban landscapes and commercial spaces in this country, as part of an effort to improve the economic and social development across the island of Mindanao, in what is believed to be the most highly-commended achievements in its business. But what does it mean for the company? Why is it going to win this award? The winner is the businessman who has won the award. The company has received the best Mixed- Use Development award, but what are the key challenges it is facing in his efforts to achieve when it comes to housing - and how it delivers its work to attract thousands of residents and people to live in an area where they are being treated as  best-used development  among those who have built these buildings instead of creating high-tech projects which appear to have made significant improvements during the 2019 property industry? Among the names of three businesses known as developers?</p>
