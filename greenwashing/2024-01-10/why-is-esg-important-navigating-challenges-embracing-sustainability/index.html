    <p>Environmental, social, and governance issues are increasingly prominent in the decision-making processes of some of the worlds biggest companies. But what is it like to be driven by market forces and businesses? Why is this growing pains in investors and consumers? The BBC s Christine Blasey looks at what happens to the challenges. () What is environmental, Social and Governance - which is the most important issue of a global agenda and how to tackle the impact on society and the environment, according to analysts, has been revealed in recent weeks. What does it mean for those who want to change the way they take their actions?

It is not always the answer to this question, but why is that being referred to as sustainable and transparent sustainability initiatives such as social and environment issues, as well as how much it can be done to help them avoid the risks of an increase in investment rates? Is it so important to think about these issues and what it is likely to have to do it for others?
