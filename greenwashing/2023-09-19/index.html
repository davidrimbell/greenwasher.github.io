  <meta name="description" content="Global Witness, an environmental NGO, has raised concerns about JBS, the world&rsquo;s largest meat company, and its proposed corporate restructure. The restructuring would give the notoriously corrupt Batista family 85% of voting rights, increasing their control over the company. Global Witness warns that this power grab poses risks to investors and the planet, as it would limit minority shareholders&#39; ability to influence issues like human rights and environmental impact. JBS has a history of deforestation, human rights abuses, and land grabs. The NGO urges financial service providers to suspend support for JBS until it addresses these concerns.
The U.S. Treasury Department has released voluntary guidance for financial institutions interested in pursuing carbon-neutral business plans. The principles aim to establish uniformity in the financial industry&rsquo;s climate pursuits and minimize greenwashing. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen emphasized the economic threat and growth opportunities of climate change, stating that the transition to a carbon-neutral economy could create $3 trillion in annual global investment opportunities. The principles call for institutions to incorporate &ldquo;transition finance&rdquo; into their strategies, including lending to, investing in, and advising clients implementing emissions-reducing policies. The principles also emphasize the importance of net-zero commitments and credible metrics and targets.
Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae are making efforts to appeal to investors interested in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) bonds in the U.S. secondary mortgage market. The government-sponsored enterprises are adding disclosures for certain repooled securitizations and introducing social labels and frameworks for traditional single-family bonds. These initiatives aim to encourage mortgage lenders to extend credit to underserved populations and regions facing housing challenges. The GSEs assign social bond labels based on scores that measure the extent to which mortgages address homeownership hurdles. Additionally, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have an ESG focus that includes sustainability and energy-efficient housing.
Salone del Mobile.Milano, a leading international trade fair for the furniture and design industry, has reaffirmed its commitment to sustainable change. The event has achieved ISO20121 certification for sustainable events management, acknowledging its efforts to prevent environmental and societal impacts. Salone del Mobile.Milano will actively participate in the Sustainable Italy initiative, showcasing its accomplishments and presenting the &ldquo;Design with Nature&rdquo; installation. The event aims to inspire effective solutions to combat climate change and become a point of reference for the sector. Salone del Mobile.Milano is dedicated to sustainability and responsible development within the industry.
A new report highlights the importance of flexible working and avoiding excessive alcohol consumption at work events for creating a more diverse and inclusive workforce. The study, conducted by experts at the University of Nottingham, found that flexible working is seen as advantageous for equality, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) by 75% of participants. Excessive alcohol consumption was found to fuel inequality, discrimination, and harassment. The study also revealed discriminatory language and behavior, career progression barriers for women and ethnic minorities, and unconscious affinity bias in recruitment and promotion practices. The findings have implications for the wider financial services industry and other workplaces. Recommendations include challenging negative attitudes towards flexible working, re-evaluating alcohol-centered activities, and implementing fair and inclusive recruitment strategies.
Mohawk Industries, a global company, has released its 2022 Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Report, highlighting its progress towards sustainability goals. The report emphasizes the company&rsquo;s commitment to sustainability, which is integrated into all aspects of its operations. Mohawk believes that sustainability is not only the right thing to do but also beneficial for its business. The report also showcases the exceptional work done by Mohawk&rsquo;s employees worldwide.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called on businesses worldwide to shift their focus from consumer rights to consumer care. In a speech at the B20 Summit in New Delhi, Modi argued that this change in approach is necessary to create a sustainable and equitable market. He emphasized the importance of genuine care for consumers and the need to build trust between businesses and consumers. Modi&rsquo;s proposal to dedicate a day to &ldquo;consumer care&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;consumer rights&rdquo; reflects a proactive approach to nurturing consumer relationships. This shift in dialogue can lead to a more harmonious and prosperous global marketplace.
RPT Realty has released its third annual Corporate Sustainability Report, highlighting its commitment to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles. The report showcases the company&rsquo;s progress in areas such as reduced electricity consumption, waste diversion, and water conservation. It also highlights social initiatives, including employee engagement and diversity, as well as community involvement through volunteerism. RPT Realty has implemented governance measures such as linking ESG goals to executive compensation and enhancing crisis management and risk assessment programs. The report can be found on the company&rsquo;s website.
Climate Week in New York City is focusing on the urgent need to mitigate the effects of climate change. The theme &ldquo;We can. We will&rdquo; reflects the positive focus on available solutions and the need for increased action. The climate transition is gaining momentum, with a growing urgency to avoid reaching a point of no return. Regulatory initiatives, such as the SEC&rsquo;s climate disclosure rule proposals, are expected to impact businesses. Trust and authenticity are key challenges for organizations in effectively communicating their climate transition efforts. The role of various stakeholders, including asset managers, banks, and NGOs, is crucial in shaping climate policy and action. ESG investing is facing challenges but may see a resurgence with more focused investment strategies. Media coverage is shifting towards highlighting solutions and innovation in climate transition. Overall, there is excitement about the progress made in the climate fight and the role of communications in driving change.
The UN Climate Summit is a critical political milestone where global leaders will come together to address the climate crisis. The top five things to know about the summit are:


The climate crisis affects all people and nations, with half of the world&rsquo;s population already living in danger zones. The UN Secretary-General has called for urgent action, stating that there is no more time to waste.


The summit will be a &ldquo;no-nonsense&rdquo; event, with no room for back-sliders or greenwashing. Countries are expected to report on their commitments to the Paris Agreement and present action plans for reducing emissions.


Government leaders will be asked to commit to more ambitious targets, including net-zero emissions and absolute emissions cuts. The goal is to limit global temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.


Business leaders and financial institutions will be expected to present transition plans aligned with UN-backed credibility standards. This includes strategies to phase out fossil fuels and advocate for science-based climate action.


The summit aims to achieve climate justice by addressing the disproportionate burden faced by the smallest polluters and holding the biggest emitters accountable. Actions will be taken to protect vulnerable nations from climate disasters and increase adaptation finance.


Overall, the summit represents an opportunity for global leaders to come together and demonstrate their commitment to creating a fairer, greener, and cleaner world for all.
