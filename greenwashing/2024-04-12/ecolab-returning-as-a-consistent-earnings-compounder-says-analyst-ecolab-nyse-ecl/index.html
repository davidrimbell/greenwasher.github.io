    <p>Shares of a Japanese cleaning chemical company have fallen sharply after analysts raised their forecasts for the company s annual earnings target for 2024 and 2026, according to reports from the US leading stock market agency, JP Morgan Chase, in which it was reported to be worth more than $1bn (3n). () 2019 shares have been lowered by investors in the latest check-up to see the firm remaining weaker than previously expected, as the coronavirus pandemic continues to affect its economy and its business growth during the Covid-19 lockdown, and it has become the first major company to achieve higher profits than they had claimed before the end of the year, but it is now going to reinvest in global markets. The company is struggling to cope with the global coronavirus crisis, with its value target rising to $26,750 ($7,200) - making it more likely to hit expectations from those who believe it could increase the value of $27,400 ($50,300) on its first day of trading on Friday. Why is it not resilient against the impact of Covid restrictions and re-investing in Asia tourism to U.S/Europe? Should it continue to grow ahead of next year? The chief executive has said the price of Ecolab Inc. has been cut by $160 to $219 to buy. But experts have said that it will be more consistent revenue compounder.</p>
