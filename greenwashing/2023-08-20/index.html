  <meta name="title" content="Building Trust in Family Businesses: Addressing the Employee Trust Gap in Nigeria"/>
  <meta name="description" content="In today&rsquo;s news, we bring you updates on the world of greenwashing, deception, and the importance of trust in business.
First, let&rsquo;s talk about family businesses in Nigeria. A recent study has revealed a significant trust gap between these businesses and their employees. While 82% of family businesses believe that employee trust is important, only 48% believe that their employees actually trust them. This lack of trust can have detrimental effects on the work environment and overall productivity. To bridge this gap, family businesses should adopt a more assertive strategy. This includes clear communication of values and purpose, commitment to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles, and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. Establishing accountability structures, encouraging employee participation, and providing regular performance reviews and feedback are also crucial steps in building trust within these businesses.
Next, we turn our attention to S&amp;P Global Ratings, a major credit rating agency. They have recently announced that they will no longer publish new ESG credit indicators. This decision comes after a multistate investigation into potential violations of consumer protection laws regarding ESG scores. The backlash against ESG continues to grow, with several states passing laws to combat ESG abuse. Additionally, evidence is mounting that ESG funds perform worse than non-ESG funds. While S&amp;P&rsquo;s decision is seen as a small victory for the anti-ESG movement, it is clear that more needs to be done to address the concerns surrounding ESG.
In the realm of sustainability, Elissa Foster, head of sustainability at Who Gives a Crap, believes that sustainability professionals now have a real seat at the table in top companies. This is a positive development, as it shows that companies are recognizing the importance of integrating environmental and social responsibility into their strategies. Foster advises sustainability professionals to evaluate the department the role sits within to understand the company&rsquo;s commitment to sustainability. She also recommends checking if the company has a legal team to ensure they are not participating in greenwashing. It is crucial for these professionals to have relevant industry experience and solid sustainability credentials to make a meaningful impact in their roles.
Lastly, we turn our attention to American retailer Target. The company has reported a decline in earnings for the first time in six years, which is being attributed to factors such as rising inflation and negative customer reaction to the company&rsquo;s LGBT Pride collection. Former Target customers who are boycotting the retailer and shopping elsewhere, including at Walmart, are said to be impacting Target&rsquo;s business. Target CEO Brian Cornell has acknowledged the negative guest reaction to the Pride collection. This is not the first time Target has faced backlash for its business decisions, with a previous boycott occurring when the company announced its inclusive restroom policy.
In conclusion, today&rsquo;s news highlights the importance of trust in business, the ongoing concerns surrounding ESG, the growing role of sustainability professionals, and the impact of customer reactions on companies&#39; bottom lines. It is crucial for businesses to prioritize trust, transparency, and ethical practices to build a positive work environment and maintain customer loyalty. Let us continue to stay informed and hold businesses accountable for their actions.
