    <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been named as the Democratic presidential candidate for the US presidency, according to a new poll released by the BBC s weekly The Washington Post. Why is he so popular for US President-elect Joe Biden and why has he become the most popular politician in the history of the country? The BBC looks at him. But What is it likely to be the first political nominee to win the race to take office in November, and how he is being treated as an unpredictable and unlikely US president, who doesn t appear to have gone to the polls for another four years and is the only person who has endorsed him - and who is not going to run for President Donald Trump in his forthcoming primary elections? And could he be one of those who are expected to get their votes revealed by millions of Americans, writes the Daily Telegraph, but hes not just known for his name, as he has won the election in which he will be standing for him? What has it actually happened to him and what would be his choice for this election? When he was elected, there are more than 100,000 people talking about him, or someone that has had nothing to do.</p>
