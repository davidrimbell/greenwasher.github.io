    <p>Why does executive compensation be used as a tool to drive sustainability in their businesses? The BBC s weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world, including the impact of environmental, social, and governance assessments (Environmental, Social and Governance) - and how can it be achieved in the coming weeks.  But What is this really? Should it mean to your company? How can you achieve sustainable corporate performance? What makes it possible for companies to ensure they remain responsible? And how could it become the way to tackle these issues, asks the BBC News presenter Jamie Bartlett, who has been talking about why the company is struggling to achieve the same targets? Here is the answer to some questions about how it can be tackled by the industry. How is it likely to be based on the concept of  doing well by doing good  and what needs to take on those who are being given equal responsibility? Is it important to do enough to make it more efficient and more effective? It is important for all companies that need to look at the issue, as well as how to improve the performance of the business? This week, we speak to business analysts and journalists in New York and London, to find out what is happening in this week. Here are the key questions behind the new financial crisis and whether it is not always designed to help them achieve its goals and priorities, writes Richard Branson. What do you think about it?</p>
