  <meta name="description" content="IT major Infosys has opened a new development centre in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh. The centre, spread across 83,750 sq. ft., will allow employees to work in a hybrid mode and attract local talent to work on global opportunities. The facility can accommodate approximately 1,000 employees and is aligned with Infosys&#39; future-ready hybrid workplace strategy. The office is also constructed to be energy-efficient and environmentally friendly. The inauguration of the centre was attended by the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, who praised Infosys for its contribution to the city&rsquo;s IT landscape and employment opportunities.
Greenwashing is a deceptive practice where companies falsely portray themselves as environmentally friendly. This can lead to negative consequences such as consumer anger, bad PR, and potential fines. The UK and US have regulations in place to address greenwashing claims. Recently, an aviation sustainability organization was found guilty of greenwashing in the UK. Google&rsquo;s Dynamic Search Ads feature can inadvertently contribute to greenwashing if used on a site with unsubstantiated environmental claims. To avoid greenwashing in Google Ads, brands should be cautious of using broad sustainability terms and ensure their claims are backed by evidence. Checking ad assets and campaigns within Google Ads can help identify potential greenwashing. It is important to substantiate sustainability claims through audits and data-backed evidence.
Abel &amp; Cole, an online retailer of organic and sustainable products, is committed to minimizing its environmental impact. The company prioritizes sustainability, high-quality produce, and premium customer service. It focuses on sourcing British produce, avoids airfreight, and has eliminated compostable packaging in favor of plastic alternatives that can be recycled. Abel &amp; Cole has also been certified as a B Corp, which measures a company&rsquo;s social and environmental impact. The retailer sets ambitious sustainability goals, including reducing carbon emissions and decarbonizing its delivery fleet. It has also introduced eco-impact labeling on its products to help shoppers make more sustainable choices.
Suncor CEO, Rich Kruger, reaffirmed the company&rsquo;s commitment to achieving a carbon-neutral footprint within 30 years. However, some MPs accused Kruger of greenwashing and not taking climate change seriously after he admitted to not reading the details of new federal regulations to cut emissions from gasoline and diesel. The regulations, which came into effect on July 1, require producers and importers to offset their emissions through investments in renewable energy or biofuels. Kruger defended himself by stating that while he hadn&rsquo;t studied the regulations in detail, the company was meeting them as required. The regulations will become more stringent each year until 2030.
City Harvest, a charity focused on food redistribution, has called on the food industry to increase efforts in redistributing surplus food to mitigate costs associated with food waste. The charity argues that by partnering with organizations like City Harvest, businesses can save on storage, waste management, and logistics expenses. However, a survey revealed a lack of awareness among donors regarding the financial benefits of food donation. City Harvest believes there is significant potential to increase donations, as only 60% of food surplus in Britain is currently redistributed. The charity recommends creating a regulatory environment conducive to food redistribution and setting ESG targets to enhance societal impact.
Meteorologists are predicting that this year&rsquo;s hurricane season will be more unpredictable due to the simultaneous presence of El Niño and elevated temperatures in the Atlantic. Climate change, caused by human activities like the combustion of fossil fuels, is leading to higher ocean temperatures. However, there is hope for a better future through progress in renewable energy sources. Iberdrola, a global energy leader, is committed to the transition to clean energy and fighting climate change. Avangrid, a subsidiary of Iberdrola, is a leader in sustainable energy and is working towards a clean, renewable, and sustainable energy future. The United Nations emphasizes the need to reduce dependence on fossil fuels to combat climate change. Renewable energy technologies have lower emissions compared to fossil fuels, and the United States has seen significant growth in renewable energy capacity. Technological advancements in wind and solar energy have made them cost competitive and reliable sources of power. Battery storage systems and better interconnections are improving the stability and reliability of renewable energy systems. The expansion of renewable energy transmission is also crucial for stable production and supply. The future of renewable energy looks promising, with advancements in technology, cost reduction, environmental protection, and government support.
