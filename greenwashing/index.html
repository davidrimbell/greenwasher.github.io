    <br/> The Bio-based and Biodegradable Materials Regulatory Network (BB-REG-NET) project, funded by Innovate UK and led by various industry and academic partners, has identified key barriers to the widespread adoption of bio-based, biodegradable, and compostable materials (BB-materials). The study, which involved extensive literature review, stakeholder engagement, and research, highlighted several challenges:  1. High costs: Bio-based materials are more expensive due to higher feedstock costs and new technology requirements. Traditional fossil-fuel industries also benefit from subsidies, putting BB-materials at a disadvantage. 2. Regulatory hurdles: UK policy lacks cohesion, favoring fossil-based plastics. 3. Performance limitations: Inconsistent durability, limited shelf life, and difficulty achieving specific properties like heat resistance hinder the adoption of BB-materials. 4. Infrastructure gaps: The UK s recycling and composting infrastructure is not equipped to handle BB-materials, leading to contamination risks. 5. Consumer confusion: Low public awareness and misunderstanding of terms like  biodegradable  contribute to greenwashing campaigns.  To address these challenges, the study suggests targeted interventions, including policy support, consumer education, and sustainable alternatives. Policy support involves developing a unified bioeconomy strategy with clear regulations and standardized certification to allow BB-materials to compete fairly with fossil-based products. Consumer education and well-crafted communications strategies are recommended to ensure correct use and disposal of BB-materials.  The study also emphasizes the positive benefits of BB-materials, such as reducing dependence on fossil fuels, cutting greenhouse gas emissions, stimulating job creation, and supporting farmers with non-food-based income streams. With the UK chemical sector aiming to source 80% of its carbon needs from non-virgin fossil sources by 2050, BB-materials are expected to cover 30% of this sustainable carbon. The BB-REG-NET hopes that further research will help polic

    <br/> Google CEO Sundar Pichai revealed in an interview that the tech giant is considering nuclear energy as a potential  green  source to power its AI data centers. This comes amidst the company s ambitious goal to achieve net-zero emissions by 2030, despite a significant increase in power consumption and greenhouse gas emissions due to the proliferation of AI data centers.  Pichai acknowledged the challenge of meeting the net-zero emissions target, especially with the scale of AI investments. To address this, Google is exploring additional investments in green energy, such as solar, and evaluating technologies like small modular nuclear reactors.  The company s interest in nuclear energy is not unique, as other tech giants like Microsoft have also signed power agreements with dormant nuclear power plants, such as Three Mile Island. Moreover, the Biden administration has closed a $1.52 billion loan with Holtec s Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan to revive it.  The funding markets are becoming more receptive to nuclear deals as governments and big tech recognize the importance of nuclear power in achieving ambitious net-zero goals. In December 2020, a note titled  Buy Uranium: Is This The Beginning Of The Next ESG Craze?  highlighted the increasing interest in uranium prices, which are expected to rise steadily over time.  In summary, Google is considering nuclear energy as a potential  green  source to power its AI data centers, joining other tech giants in exploring this option to meet their net-zero emissions targets. The funding markets are also showing growing interest in nuclear deals, as governments and big tech understand the crucial role of nuclear power in achieving ambitious climate goals.

    <br/> Rukiyah, a TikToker, recently shared a video that went viral, amassing 9.9 million views, to debunk misconceptions about grass-fed beef. Contrary to popular belief, grass-fed simply means the cattle are fed grass, not necessarily that they are pasture-raised. Rukiyah s video highlights the confusion between grass-fed and pasture-raised, with the latter implying the animals are free-roaming and living off the land.  The FDA s minimum standard for grass-fed beef allows for greenwashing and marketplace deceit, as animals may be kept indoors or fed hay instead of grazing. While most grass-fed beef is raised outside at pasture, some may also be finished on grain. To ensure a pasture-raised and grass-fed cow, the food packaging must explicitly state both.  The debate between grass-fed and grain-fed beef centers on nutritional differences. Grass-fed beef generally contains less total fat and more healthy fats like Omega 3s and Conjugated linoleic acid. However, it can be more expensive, making it a less viable option for some consumers. Grain-fed beef, while potentially less nutritious, remains a cost-effective source of protein.  Rukiyah s video sparked discussions among viewers, with many already aware of the differences between pasture-raised and grass-fed meat. Some viewers emphasized the importance of supporting small farmers who genuinely raise grass-fed pasture-raised animals.  In summary, Rukiyah s viral video shed light on the misconceptions surrounding grass-fed beef, emphasizing the need for clear labeling to distinguish between grass-fed and pasture-raised meat. The debate between grass-fed and grain-fed beef continues, with nutritional benefits and cost considerations playing a significant role in consumer choices.

    <a href="https://green-washer.com/greenwashing/2024-10-03/how-are-countries-reporting-progress-toward-net-zero-commitments/">How Are Countries Reporting Progress Toward Net - Zero Commitments ? </a>
    <br/> Countries are increasingly setting political and policy commitments to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with many aiming for this goal by 2050. To track progress toward these commitments, it is crucial for governments to monitor, assess, and report on their advancements. This process not only aids in improving planning but also promotes accountability, transparency, and trust among stakeholders.  The World Resources Institute (WRI) reviewed various net-zero reporting methodologies and national processes to understand how countries can report on their progress. The assessment highlighted the need for clear definitions of net-zero targets, including scope and legal status, and the importance of monitoring sector-specific actions and cross-cutting enabling actions. These actions encompass finance, governance, stakeholder engagement, carbon dioxide removal, and just transition.  Different methodologies and frameworks have been established by organizations to assess net-zero progress. These frameworks often track both sectoral and enabling actions using an indicator-based approach. Transparent reporting on carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is also crucial, with countries needing to specify targets for emission reductions and removals, and provide methodologies and assumptions in line with the Paris Agreement.  Countries are not required to report on net-zero progress under the Paris Agreement, leading to a variety of national reporting practices. For example, Canada has a reporting process outlined in the Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act, Chile has decentralized net-zero implementation across several government agencies, and the United Kingdom has detailed plans for meeting carbon budgets.  To report internationally on their net-zero progress, countries can use the Paris Agreement s Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF). This includes reporting on policies and measures, projections for future GHG emissions, and tracking progress made in implementing and achieving Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).  To enhance understanding and advance good practices for assessing progress, further research, dialogue, and capacity building are needed. Countries with net-zero targets but without a defined tracking system can learn from their peers and establish relevant processes for institutionalizing reporting.

    <br/> Thailand is set to become a significant player in the global gaming and tourism industry, with integrated resorts (IRs) projected to generate annual revenues between US$1.5 billion and US$5 billion, potentially contributing up to 1% to the country s GDP. JP Morgan s analysis suggests that large-scale projects in Bangkok, with an estimated budget of US$3-6 billion, could start operations by 2031, yielding EBITDA between US$0.4 billion and US$1.5 billion and an internal rate of return of 12-29%. The government s approach to awarding licenses will be pivotal, with one to three licenses initially granted for Bangkok projects, followed by smaller regional complexes.  IRs in Bangkok are expected to draw a substantial number of foreign tourists, with gross gaming revenue (GGR) projected to account for over 90% of total revenues, despite occupying only about 5% of the total gross floor area. Thailand s diverse tourist attractions and cultural offerings are expected to give it a competitive edge over major gaming hubs like Macau and Singapore.  The Thai government is working on the Entertainment Complex (EC) Bill, which is expected to be deliberated in parliament later this year. This legislation aims to formalize the gambling sector and redirect the substantial underground economy into the formal sector. Potential operators, including global giants like Galaxy Entertainment Group, Genting Singapore, and MGM China, are anticipated to form joint ventures with local entities to leverage regional expertise in land and property management.  However, the entry into the casino business carries potential risks, particularly related to investment based on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria. Around half of sustainable AUM globally are subject to gambling exclusions, posing a challenge for Thai companies aiming to attract ESG-focused investments. With the legislation expected to be in place between 2024 and 2026 and official bidding projected for at least 2028, the path towards realizing these integrated resorts requires careful planning and execution.

    <br/> MarketAxess Holdings Inc., a prominent electronic trading platform specializing in fixed-income securities, has released trading volume and preliminary variable transaction fees (FPM) for September 2024 and the third quarter concluding on September 30, 2024. The company s CEO, Chris Concannon, made the announcement, highlighting the significance of these figures in understanding the platform s performance and market activity during the specified period.  The trading volume and FPM data for September 2024 and the third quarter ending September 30, 2024, provide valuable insights into the market dynamics and investor behavior. The trading volume reflects the number of securities traded during the period, while the FPM represents the variable transaction fees charged per million units of traded securities.  The release of this information by MarketAxess allows investors, market participants, and analysts to assess the liquidity and cost-efficiency of the platform. Higher trading volumes indicate a more active market, which can be beneficial for investors seeking to execute large orders without significantly impacting the market price. Conversely, lower trading volumes may suggest a less active market, potentially leading to wider bid-ask spreads and higher transaction costs.  The variable transaction fees, or FPM, are an essential aspect of the trading experience on MarketAxess. These fees are charged per million units of traded securities and can impact the overall cost of executing trades. A lower FPM can make the platform more attractive to investors, as it reduces the expenses associated with trading activities.  In summary, MarketAxess Holdings Inc. s announcement of trading volume and preliminary FPM for September 2024 and the third quarter ending September 30, 2024, provides crucial information for market participants. The data sheds light on the platform s performance, liquidity, and cost-efficiency, enabling investors and analysts to make informed decisions about their trading strategies and investment choices.

    <br/> Pertamina Group, a major Indonesian energy company, is actively developing a bioethanol ecosystem to support the country s energy transition and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. The initiative is part of a long-term strategy, starting from 2024 to 2035, to increase the production of bioethanol as a raw material for Pertamax Green, a bioethanol-blended fuel.  The current national ethanol production capacity stands at around 180,000 kiloliters per year, but the demand for ethanol blends, such as E5 and E10, is much higher, with a need of 1.9 million kiloliters per year. To address this gap, Pertamina NRE has signed an agreement with PT Sinergi Gula Nusantara to construct a new bioethanol plant in Glenmore, Banyuwangi, with a capacity of 30,000 kiloliters per year.  In addition to sugar cane, Pertamina is exploring other potential raw materials for bioethanol production, such as sorghum, nipah, and empty bunches of palm oil. The company aims to diversify the types of raw materials used to avoid interfering with the national need for sugar cane for food.  The transport sector, a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in Indonesia, is a key target for the use of environmentally friendly fuel. The government has encouraged the development of bioethanol as a blend for gasoline-type fuels through Presidential Regulation No. 40 of 2023.  Pertamina s commitment to developing clean energy aligns with the government s aspiration of achieving net zero emissions by 2060. The development of bioethanol not only supports Indonesia s enhanced nationally determined contribution (ENDC) target but also has the potential to create great value by opening up job opportunities in the raw material cultivation and distribution sectors.  Pertamina Vice President Corporate Communication Fadjar Djoko Santoso highlighted the company s potential in bioethanol development, emphasizing its role

    <br/> The implementation of legal entity identifiers (LEIs) in Australia s over-the-counter (OTC) derivative transaction reporting marks a significant shift in financial regulations. LEIs, unique identifiers for entities in the global financial system, have been instrumental in enhancing transparency and security in financial markets. However, their adoption has been uneven across jurisdictions due to factors like technological readiness and concerns over sovereignty.  Despite initial skepticism, LEIs have proven valuable in identifying legal entities, improving regulatory oversight, and enabling authorities to respond to emerging risks more effectively. They have also facilitated a more consistent approach to cross-border financial regulations, although full harmonization remains a work in progress.  In Australia, the compulsory use of LEIs for OTC transactions from October onwards raises questions about the broader legacy of LEIs and the importance of regular renewals for maintaining data integrity and accuracy. While the non-compulsory renewal policy may pose some limitations, the move towards streamlined OTC reporting is seen as a positive step.  Overall, LEIs have contributed to increased credibility, transactional security, and transparency in financial markets. As global regulations continue to evolve, the role of LEIs in preventing market disruptions and aligning with international standards becomes increasingly crucial. However, ongoing dialogue between regulators and industry stakeholders is essential to achieve full harmonization and maximize the benefits of LEIs.

    <br/> Texas Governor Greg Abbott expressed optimism that the establishment of the Texas Stock Exchange will elevate Dallas to become the leading financial center in the United States. Abbott believes that the addition of a stock exchange to Dallas will solidify its position as the financial heartbeat of the country. He highlighted that Texas already employs more people in financial services than New York, and the recent expansion of data centers in the state will support rapid transaction speeds once the exchange is operational.  Abbott met with officials from the new bourse, which has raised $135 million with backing from investors like BlackRock Inc. and Citadel Securities. The exchange plans to file registration documents with the SEC in the coming months.  The Texas governor also discussed the possibility of listing Elon Musk s companies on the exchange, receiving a positive response. Musk s companies, including SpaceX, Neuralink, and X, align with the exchange s approach to business.  The Texas Stock Exchange aims to reduce burdensome regulations for businesses, notably by not imposing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) thresholds on listed companies. This stance aligns with the Texas Republican Party s efforts to crack down on ESG investment practices.  In summary, the Texas Stock Exchange is poised to transform Dallas into the top financial center in the U.S., with Governor Abbott and other officials working to change perceptions of the U.S. financial landscape outside of New York. The exchange s focus on reducing regulations and its potential to attract companies like Musk s further solidify its role in the financial sector.

    <br/> Greenwashing, the act of misleading the public about environmental efforts, is increasingly prevalent as the climate crisis worsens. This deceptive practice hinders the achievement of global climate change objectives. A notable instance of greenwashing involved the Paris 2024 Olympic organising committee, which aimed to create the most eco-friendly games by reducing plastic waste. However, concerns arose due to the continued use of plastic bottles and cups by Coca-Cola, a major sponsor.  Other high-profile cases include oil giant Shell, airlines AirFrance, Etihad, and Lufthansa, and bank HSBC, all of which faced ad campaign bans in the UK for allegedly misleading the public about their climate efforts. Shell disputed the claims, while Etihad and Lufthansa revised their advertisements post-ruling. HSBC pledged to better engage customers in the low-carbon economy transition.  These incidents raise questions about board directors  effectiveness in driving environmental change. Boards, elected by shareholders, are responsible for overseeing corporate activities and ensuring alignment with climate change goals. A study of large US companies revealed that co-opted boards, where directors are appointed after the chief executive s tenure begins, can decrease greenhouse gas emissions intensity in industries affected by climate change. However, this relationship varies over time, and emissions may decline more slowly with increased research and development investments.  Co-opted boards can also lead to over-investment in inefficient research and development projects, such as poorly designed carbon-reduction programs or unproven renewable technologies. This misalignment with financial and ESG goals can result in approving projects that do not support the company s objectives.  To address these issues, several steps can be taken. First, prioritizing the appointment of independent directors with no ties to top executives or major stakeholders can provide objective oversight and hold managers accountable for their environmental actions. Regulators can establish clear guidelines for board composition and independence. Investors can use their influence through resolutions and votes to push for more climate change
