      <h2>Companies Collaborate to Create Climate-friendly Rules and Practices</h2>
      <p>Global CO2 emissions are still going up, even though we need to reduce them by 7% each year to reach our climate goals by 2050. Only a small part of the world&rsquo;s carbon emissions are covered by plans to reach net zero, so companies have a tough choice to make. They can either do their fair share and hope others do too, or they can ignore the goals altogether. But some companies, like Holcim, are working together with other businesses and regulators to make rules that are good for the climate.</p>
<p>TriNet, a company that helps with human resources, has shared its 2023 report on the environment, social issues, and good business practices. The report shows that TriNet is committed to being sustainable, socially responsible, and having good leadership. They have programs to help underrepresented businesses, use cloud storage instead of paper, include everyone, use less paper for paychecks, do good things for the community, and have rules for vendors. The report is meant to be honest with the people who care about TriNet and show what the company believes in.</p>
<p>AqVerium and Frost &amp; Sullivan have made the first &ldquo;Blue Taxonomy&rdquo; to sort out different ways that water is used and make sure it&rsquo;s done right. The Blue Taxonomy wants to make water management better and more sustainable. It will help people who make the rules, researchers, and people who work with water understand how to use it well.</p>
<p>The International WELL Building Institute and City Sanctuary Developments are working together to make homes that are good for people&rsquo;s health and well-being. City Sanctuary will be one of the first to use the WELL program for homes. The program has more than 100 ways to make homes healthy and strong, for both families and people who live in big buildings.</p>
<p>The Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures has made a plan to help organizations make good decisions that help nature and use money in the right way. The plan says that companies should tell the truth about how they affect nature and make sure they don&rsquo;t hurt it. They should also be clear about what matters most and take steps to reduce risks.</p>
<p>In Australia, people like to use food packaging that can be composted because they think it&rsquo;s good for the environment. But a lot of that packaging ends up in landfills, where it can make harmful gases and have bad chemicals. We need better rules and systems to make sure composting is done safely.</p>
<p>When oil rigs in the ocean are not used anymore, they can cause problems for the environment. But if we take them apart or change them in the right way, they can actually help. They can become homes for sea creatures and be changed to store carbon. But we have to be careful and honest about how we take care of them.</p>
<p>In the end, companies, groups, and people need to be honest and responsible about how they help the environment. We can&rsquo;t just say nice things, we have to actually do them. It&rsquo;s important to think about the future and make changes that will help the next generation.</p>
