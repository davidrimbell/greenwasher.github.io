    <p> The organization  Canada Powered by Women  has been criticized for its apparent bias against electric vehicles (EVs) and climate policies, with a focus on the environmental and financial drawbacks of EVs. The group, founded by oil and gas executives, is seen as a front for the fossil fuel industry, aiming to undermine the transition away from oil and gas. Their blog posts and op-eds often question the viability of EVs and climate policies, with titles suggesting skepticism towards net-zero homes and carbon taxes.  The group s spokesperson, Jenn Lomas, states that the organization s funding comes from individual donations and organizations in various industries, including financial services, real estate, and energy. However, Lomas refuses to provide a list of donors, citing confidentiality.  Canada Powered by Women claims to represent over 5.6 million engaged women, aiming to amplify their voices in decision-making roles. However, critics argue that the group s messaging is a smokescreen for fossil fuel promotion, targeting women to recruit potential consumers, investors, and shareholders.  Research suggests that women s leadership in government leads to stronger environmental protections and climate policies. Women are also disproportionately affected by climate change, with higher susceptibility to mental health impacts. Despite this, the organization s stance on EVs and climate policies is seen as misaligned with the interests of women and the environment.  In summary,  Canada Powered by Women  has been criticized for its biased messaging against electric vehicles and climate policies, with concerns that the group is a front for the fossil fuel industry. The organization s focus on the drawbacks of EVs and climate policies is seen as misaligned with the interests of women and the environment, despite research showing the benefits of women s leadership in these areas.</p>
