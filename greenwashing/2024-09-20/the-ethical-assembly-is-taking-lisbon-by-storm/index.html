    <p> The Ethical Assembly, set for October 2nd and 3rd at the Beato Innovation District, is a sustainability-focused event that aims to provide a platform for diverse voices and solutions, free from the influence of large corporations. Organized by Patricia, who has worked with top sustainability experts, the event seeks to address the issue of greenwashing and lobbying prevalent in major industry events. The Ethical Assembly will feature a lineup of speakers and partners committed to making a significant impact on climate change, with no hidden agendas or waste.  The event will have two main stages, 150 speakers, 70 sessions, and a maximum of 1,000 attendees. Additional spaces will host workshops, labs, networking areas, a climate café, and art and photography exhibitions. Attendees can also enjoy 20 short and documentary film screenings, including the Portuguese premiere of Soil, and a keynote by actress and author Lily Cole.  The Ethical Assembly caters to both professionals and the general public, with industry sessions running from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and a more relaxed atmosphere for the public from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. The event aims to democratize access to the climate conversation, inspiring meaningful contributions to the climate change dialogue.  Organizing the Ethical Assembly has presented significant financial risks due to the rejection of big polluter sponsorship. Patricia and the organizers are seeking support through ticket sales, donations, and volunteer assistance. The event is a call to action for everyone to join in the fight against climate change and work towards a better future.
