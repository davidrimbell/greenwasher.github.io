    <p> Fuse Fleet, a new venture that commenced operations in April 2023, is a collaborative effort between DKG Insurance Group and Greater Than. The company initially concentrated on providing behavior-based insurance, which incentivizes safe driving by offering reduced premiums. Recently, Fuse Fleet has expanded its services by introducing an Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reporting tool. This tool aligns with the evolving concerns of fleet operators who are now placing a greater emphasis on sustainability.  The ESG reporting tool is designed to help fleet operators measure and report their environmental impact, social responsibility, and governance practices. By doing so, it enables them to better understand and manage their sustainability efforts. This tool is particularly relevant in the context of the growing awareness and demand for environmentally friendly and socially responsible business practices.  The introduction of the ESG reporting tool signifies Fuse Fleet s commitment to addressing the changing priorities of fleet operators. As the industry shifts towards sustainability, Fuse Fleet aims to provide comprehensive solutions that not only reward safe driving but also promote eco-friendly and socially responsible operations. This expansion of services demonstrates the company s adaptability and foresight in catering to the needs of modern fleet operators.  In summary, Fuse Fleet, initially focused on behavior-based insurance, has recently introduced an ESG reporting tool to cater to the increasing demand for sustainability among fleet operators. This tool helps fleet operators measure and report their environmental impact, social responsibility, and governance practices, ultimately contributing to a more sustainable and responsible transportation industry.</p>
