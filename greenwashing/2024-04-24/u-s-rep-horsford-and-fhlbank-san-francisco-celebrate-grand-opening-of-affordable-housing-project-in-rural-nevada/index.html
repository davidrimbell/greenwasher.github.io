S . Rep . Horsford and FHLBank San Francisco Celebrate Grand Opening of Affordable Housing Project in Rural Nevada</a>
    <p>Congressman Henry Horsford has opened a new housing development in Nevada, marking the first time he has been elected as president of the Black Caucus in the US state of New York. Why is it important to celebrate the successful opening of Hafen Village apartments, and why is the project worth millions of dollars to help residents in rural communities?.

What does it mean for his leadership? When he becomes the Speaker of Congress, he will be celebrating his success in his role as chief executive of US Congress and the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (FHLBank) - and what could be the key to his commitment to improving community growth and helping those who are struggling to live and work in local areas of rural America?
