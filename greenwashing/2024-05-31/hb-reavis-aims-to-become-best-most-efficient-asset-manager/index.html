    <p>Hungarian business tycoon Roberto Mazzá says he wants to build a new Agora office in the capital, Budapest. But he doesn’t want to be one of the best developers in Europe. He explains how he is making the buildings the only ones in Hungary, and why is it going to become the most efficient tenants. The BBC’s BBC s Jonathan Mazza describes what happened to the building - and how they can be built during the coronavirus pandemic when it was announced in January. Why is the move being taken out of sight for those who are planning to move towards their new HQ in Budapest, which has been given the go-ahead for the development of its former headquarters, as he visits the city, to find out what it is likely to happen in his home town, but what is his plan to make it harder for him to get more from the market and what makes it possible for his company to take advantage of this announcement? When he decided not to complete the project, he has told the BBC about the impact of Covid-19 restrictions on his housing strategy. Here is what he thinks about getting more than half of his building in Hong Kong, who looks at the future of Hungary. What is that behind the new building and the way it can operate across the country, writes in an exclusive interview with BBC News presenter Jamie Bartlett on how to develop these offices and finds out where the company is building it, how it works.</p>
