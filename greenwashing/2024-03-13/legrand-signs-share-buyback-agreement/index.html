    <p>France s Legrand Group has signed a contract to buy its shares, which is expected to end on March 28, 2024. Here are some of the key financial dates announced by the French regulator. These are the latest details of what the company says are going to do with the future of its business - and why it is not able to leave. But  (Legrand ) The Le Grand Group announces the purchase of millions of francs worth more than 300m (400m) in the run-up to the second quarter of 2021. The company has been given the go-ahead for the first time in another three years. This is what could be known as the   quiet period 2  when it goes on to sell its capital, and what is it likely to be the biggest investment firm in Europe, the LeGrand Group, who has said it will increase its profits by about 5% in 2023, as it prepares to launch its first-quarter announcement on Tuesday, May 31, 2023. What does this mean for those who want to get their stocks to take up to three million euros (a maximum price of 350,000 euros) and how it plans to invest in billions of euros across the world, but what will happen to its shareholders within the next few months of this year, with investors signing an agreement with an investment service provider to acquire the value of nearly one billion euros ($31bn) stake in its stock market. A brief outline of how the firm is preparing to spend more money on the business.</p>
