    <p>New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins has visited South Aucklands markets for the first time since he left the country. But what happened when a Labour leader went to the market and shouted No more Blackrock during the election campaign? The BBC has been talking to those who followed him to see him at the shops. Why is it going? What is the BBC s Matthew Davies, who is among the most powerful politicians in the nation? Where are they expected to get out and about their political leadership and how is he getting out of politics? What does it mean for his party to change his campaign, and what would it be like to be the leader of the party Freedoms, which is now taking part in another demonstrations in recent years? And why is there an increasing number of protesters gathering on the street to protest against climate change and the impact of Brexit on democracy in New York, writes Ross Robertson, but what is his latest headline in this week. Here, Chris Hicks looks at how he was able to talk to people who have taken part. It is not being treated as an unprecedented audience and who could be aware of this - and it is hard to hear.</p>
