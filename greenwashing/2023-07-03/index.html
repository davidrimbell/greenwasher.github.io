  <meta name="description" content="Bud Light Faces Backlash for Lack of Support to Transgender Influencer
Bud Light, the popular beer brand, is facing significant financial losses after partnering with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. Mulvaney criticized the company for not publicly supporting him and waiting for things to improve. Instead of apologizing, Bud Light seemed offended by Mulvaney&rsquo;s comments. This controversy raises questions about who controls Bud Light and why companies would rather self-destruct than not promote the trans-lobby.
JCDecaux Appoints Head of ESG for Australia and New Zealand
JCDecaux, an out-of-home media company, has appointed Alexandra Heaven as its first head of ESG for Australia and New Zealand. Heaven will be responsible for implementing the company&rsquo;s global ESG strategy in the region. JCDecaux has already made significant progress in ESG, including launching carbon neutral advertising products and achieving certifications for carbon neutrality and sustainable business practices. The company is committed to being a leader in the industry and has received recognition for its ESG performance.
Kenya&rsquo;s World Rally Championship Promotes Environmental Responsibility
The 2023 World Rally Championship held in Naivasha, Kenya showcased the importance of environmental responsibility in motorsport. KCB, a leading bank, took the lead in promoting a greener future by planting 500 trees and offsetting the rally&rsquo;s carbon footprint. The bank also educated and empowered its suppliers to integrate sustainable practices into their business. The rally site was transformed into an eco-friendly haven, with recycled materials used for decorations and furniture. Waste management was prioritized, with proper segregation and collection of waste. The event concluded with the ground left immaculate, demonstrating a commitment to environmental sustainability. KCB&rsquo;s efforts serve as an inspiring example for others to prioritize sustainability in all aspects of life.
Shift Towards Alternative Fuels and Electric Buses in School Transportation
The majority of school buses in the U.S. and Canada still run on diesel fuel, but there is a growing shift towards alternative fuels and electric buses. Propane is currently the most widely-used alternative fuel, followed by electric buses. Biodiesel is not considered an alternative fuel because it complements diesel, while renewable diesel is a sustainable alternative fuel. Compressed natural gas (CNG) has been popular on the West Coast but is now being surpassed by electric buses. The EPA has introduced the Clean School Bus Program, which provides funding for the replacement of zero- and low-emission school buses.
Challenges and Realities of ESG Investing
ESG investing, which focuses on environmental, social, and governance factors, is facing challenges as investors move from shares to bonds for higher returns. However, a study suggests that ESG investing may be counterproductive in reducing emissions. Green companies, which have lower emissions, do not necessarily reduce their emissions further when they have a lower cost of capital. On the other hand, brown companies, which have higher emissions, become dirtier when starved of capital. Additionally, efforts to prevent new oil and gas production can result in importing expensive hydrocarbons. It is important to be realistic and recognize that environmentally unfriendly companies are still necessary for certain goods, and government intervention is needed to properly account for pollution costs.
Addressing Greenwashing in the Electric Vehicle Industry
Electric vehicles (EVs) have gained global attention as a promising solution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. However, there is concern about greenwashing in the EV industry, where companies make misleading claims about the environmental benefits of their products. Greenwashing often neglects the entire lifecycle of EVs, including production, sourcing of materials, and end-of-life disposal. Transparency and clear standards are needed to address greenwashing, and governments and regulatory bodies should enforce environmental standards for EV production. Consumer awareness and education are also important in demanding genuine sustainability. While greenwashing exists, EV adoption still offers significant benefits compared to conventional vehicles when powered by renewable energy sources.
New Sustainability Standards Aim to Improve Disclosures in Global Capital Markets
The International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) has released its first-ever standards, IFRS S1 and IFRS S2, which aim to improve sustainability-related disclosures in global capital markets. These standards will help companies communicate the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on their prospects, enhancing trust and confidence in sustainability disclosures for investment decisions. The Energy &amp; Environment Alliance (EEA), focused on achieving net-zero carbon and ESG stewardship in the hospitality industry, has welcomed the new standards and emphasized the need for industry collaboration to prepare for their adoption in 2024. The standards incorporate recommendations from the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).
ESG Investing and the Need for Realistic Approaches
ESG investing, which focuses on environmental, social, and governance factors, may not be as effective as it seems. A study found that companies with high ESG scores do not necessarily reduce emissions, while companies labeled as &ldquo;brown&rdquo; become dirtier when starved of capital. This means that ESG investing may actually transfer capital from good to bad companies. Additionally, the push for green investing can have unintended consequences, such as large oil producers offloading assets to improve their green credentials, only for the assets to become dirtier under new ownership. It is important to recognize that completely eliminating the impact on the environment is not feasible overnight, and investments from both &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; and green industries are needed to address environmental challenges.
Investing in Underserved Communities and Promoting ESG Practices
The rise of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices in corporations is setting new standards for societal and sustainability policies. However, the impact of ESG and eco-friendly investment is not always immediate for underserved communities. Some commercial real estate investors, like Primestor, are taking action to revitalize and positively engage these communities. Primestor focuses on intense-use urban markets, providing resources like fresh food and financial institutions. They involve residents in the development process and prioritize local hiring. Despite a lack of available bank funding, Primestor continues to invest and develop, recently closing on its own investment fund.
In conclusion, greenwashing continues to be a concern in various industries, from beer companies to the electric vehicle industry. It is crucial for companies to prioritize genuine sustainability practices and transparently communicate their efforts. Additionally, investors and consumers should be aware of the challenges and realities of ESG investing, recognizing the need for a balanced approach. Ultimately, the goal should be to create a more sustainable future for all, including underserved communities who may not immediately benefit from ESG practices.
