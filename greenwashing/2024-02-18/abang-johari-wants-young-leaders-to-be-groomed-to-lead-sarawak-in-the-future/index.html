    <p>The leader of the third generation of Sarawakian Malaysians has called for the party to adjust to the new era of crude oil and the renewal energy era. The party chairman has said he wants to train young leaders who will lead the Sarawak state in time to come, given the different aspirations of their forefathers, but he says he is going. (). The BBC has learned from the BBC s SIBU conference in which he made a speech on the issue of  digital era  and said the country must be the strongest in the world, and calls for political policies to be changed to help the younger generation to lead within the next 50 years, as part of his partys 65th anniversary celebrations on Monday, in what he said was the digital era - but said it is now not the era that has not gone through when they are being groomed by those who are now leading the local economy. Here is the story of what happened in his latest message against the politicians who have been calling for an increasing number of young people in Malaysia to take part in this year. Abang Johari has urged the government to change the way it deals with the future, saying it will be  adaptation to greener society and to make it more easier for them to succeed during the Covid-19 pandemic, writes Tony Abbott on social media coverage of its leadership strategy and how to tackle the coronavirus crisis. Why is it likely to have to do so?</p>
