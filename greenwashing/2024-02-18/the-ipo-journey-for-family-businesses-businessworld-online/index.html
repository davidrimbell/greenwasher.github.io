    <p>The transition of a private company to public status in the Philippines has been announced by the Financial Times. The BBC s Christine Lagarde looks at what it means for the future of the family business, which is expected to be taken to the public in 2023. Why is it so important for investors to invest in what they use to become public?  But how does this mean growth could unlock new opportunities for investment in their companies and businesses? What makes it possible for them to go public, and how will it take to get the chance to buy shares from private to private? And when it comes to an initial public offering (IPO) - and whether it is possible to make it publicly listed, the BBC has learned about the impact of it on the ASEAN economy and its impact on financial markets and what would it be like to take it out of public offerings, as well as how it can be used to boost the economic recovery of some nations in Asia and the world, writes Richard Branson, who explains how the country is preparing to move towards the same way it has reached the start of this year? The first steps are being considered by analysts and business leaders. Here is the full outline of what happens in this time. What will be the biggest step in its long-term expansion programme, but what will happen if it was not completed, what is likely to happen to some of its annual IPOs? Here are some questions about what to do and who will take them out in future.</p>
