    <p> Climate Week NYC concluded with significant discussions on closing the climate finance gap and the role of public-private partnerships. The event highlighted the need for stronger financial instruments to support climate projects in emerging markets and emphasized the importance of transition finance. Policymakers and private investors were urged to collaborate more closely to mobilize climate investments.  The focus shifted to COP29 in Baku, where setting a New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) on climate finance was underway, particularly to support emerging and developing markets. The integration of climate finance with global megatrends, such as through the G20 and Davos, was discussed.  Roundtable sessions addressed the risks of greenwashing and the role of AI in identifying such risks. The importance of quantifying physical and transitional risks to build resilient portfolios was emphasized.  The transformative power of climate tech was also a key theme, with discussions on breaking down regulatory and technical barriers to enable greater investment in these technologies.  The event also featured discussions on the Arctic and the need for inclusive climate action. The importance of engaging the leadership and innovations of Arctic peoples in strategic climate collaborations was highlighted.  In summary, Climate Week NYC brought together diverse perspectives on climate finance, policy interventions, and the role of technology in addressing climate change. The event emphasized the need for collaboration between policymakers and private investors, as well as the importance of addressing greenwashing risks and leveraging climate tech for sustainable finance. The discussions also highlighted the urgency of taking action to close the climate finance gap and support emerging and developing markets.</p>
