    <p> Mayer Brown, an international law firm with a network of 27 offices worldwide, is recognized for its expertise in the derivatives market. The firm s team of nearly 60 lawyers, based in key locations like New York, Chicago, and London, serves clients from the world s largest banks across the US, Canada, and Europe. Mayer Brown s dominance in both the US and UK markets is evident, with its offices in Europe becoming increasingly crucial post-Brexit.  The firm s clients value the ability to receive comprehensive advice on regulatory matters across the US, UK, and EU. Mayer Brown s integrated global practice is reflected in its extensive regulatory work, including insights into topics like the Volcker Rule and security-based swap dealer issues. The firm also played a crucial role in helping market participants understand the impact of expanding sanctions regimes following the war in Ukraine.  Mayer Brown is at the forefront of emergent trends, such as ESG products and carbon emissions-linked products. The firm has helped clients develop proprietary ESG indices and provided guidance on regulatory treatment of emissions products in the US and EU markets.  In the rapidly evolving crypto and tokenization space, Mayer Brown has achieved notable successes, including a high-profile CFTC registration for a futures exchange client and advising a major European lender on a tokenized debt instrument in the US. The firm s strengths in structured products are also recognized, with the largest share of the US market and one of the largest practices in Europe.  Overall, Mayer Brown s global reach, regulatory expertise, and innovative approach to emerging trends make it a market leader in the derivatives industry. The firm s ability to provide comprehensive advice across multiple jurisdictions and its dedication to staying ahead of the curve have earned it recognition as the Americas Derivatives Law Firm of the Year and the European derivatives law firm of the year.</p>
