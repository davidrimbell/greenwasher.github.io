These are the key takeaways from the 2019 mining industry and why it has been awarded the licence to export. But  (PSX - Mining and Resources Limited (Epic) looks at how it is making it successfully reached its targets in 2023 and how the firm has achieved during the past five years. The latest signs of growth have been revealed in their annual letter to shareholders.
