  <meta name="description" content="Greenwashing is when companies try to make themselves seem more environmentally friendly than they really are. It&rsquo;s important for people to know about this and make sure companies are being honest. Here are some recent examples:


Bradesco Bank and Eve Mobilidade Aérea Urbana:
Bradesco Bank is working with Eve Mobilidade Aérea Urbana to help make eco-friendly electric planes. This shows that Bradesco Bank cares about the environment and sets a good example for other companies.


Procurement Challenges and ESG Compliance:
People who buy things for companies have a hard time because of things like politics, making sure the supply chain is strong, and following the rules. Using B2B marketplaces can help with these problems. But it&rsquo;s important to think about the environment and follow all the rules.


IR Professionals and Sustainability:
People who work with investors have to change how they talk about their company. They need to show how they are being responsible and share data. A big conference called COP28 talked about how important it is to be sustainable when it comes to investing.


DSF L&amp;I&rsquo;s Commitment to ESG:
DSF L&amp;I is a company in Korea that is doing a good job of being sustainable. They have a system to reuse containers and they won a big award for being good at being sustainable. This shows that they care about the environment.


Scottish Widows&#39; Green Pensions Report:
Scottish Widows did a study and found out that a lot of people in the UK don&rsquo;t know much about &ldquo;green pensions.&rdquo; If people knew more, it could help stop a lot of carbon emissions. Scottish Widows wants the government, employers, and pension companies to teach people about the benefits of green pensions.


Industrial Bank&rsquo;s ESG Leadership:
Industrial Bank in China got a really good rating for being sustainable. They are good at green finance, helping small businesses, and being responsible. This is why they got a high rating.


Kumi Naidoo&rsquo;s Fight Against Greenwashing:
Kumi Naidoo is an activist who fights against investing in fossil fuels. He also helps people who are hurt by climate change. Clean Creatives is a group that works with Naidoo to stop greenwashing in the fossil fuel industry.


iHuman Inc.&rsquo;s ESG Commitment:
iHuman Inc. made a report about how they are being responsible. They care about kids, following the rules, protecting information, the environment, equality, and fairness. They want to make the world better.


In conclusion, people need to be careful about greenwashing because it makes it hard to know which companies are really helping the environment. By learning more and supporting companies that care about sustainability, we can help make the world cleaner and better.
