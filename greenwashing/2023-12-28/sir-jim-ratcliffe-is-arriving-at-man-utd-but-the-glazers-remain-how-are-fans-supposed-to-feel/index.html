    <p>When the Glazer family decided to take control of the Glazers, it would be a very good time for the club to leave the UK. But what happened when it was announced that the Qatari company wanted to buy the team, the BBC s weekly The Boss series profiles some of those who went on to find out what they were. () What is the story behind these announcements. Why is it likely to be the first time it had been given the go-ahead for Manchester United, and what is going to happen in the future? The BBC looks at why the group turned out to have become the worlds most successful players in their career. What happens to the Red Knights, which played Cardiff City, who is now taking over the Glozers - and how could it make it possible for them to get the ownership of Manchester City? These are the reasons for being able to make headlines in recent years, but what does it look like to change the way it has taken over, with millions of people talking about the prospect of an estimated 20bn of money to sell it to one of its owners, as well as how the Gulf appeared to see it as an unprecedented amount of time to keep it away from the Premier League. The latest reports from BBC Newsnight explains how it came to an end of this year. Here, we look at how much it can be done to save the Green Arrows and the chances of re-election?</p>
