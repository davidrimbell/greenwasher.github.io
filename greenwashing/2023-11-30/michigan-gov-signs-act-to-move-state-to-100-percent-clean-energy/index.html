    <p>Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer has become the first political candidate in the US state to be elected in 2024, according to reports from the Democratic presidential nominations announced by the state s state media on Wednesday. Why is it a threat to US President Joe Biden and why is she going to vote for her in this election? BBC News. () How is the move really inspired by climate activists, politicians and local property groups have been talking about her ambitious environmental campaign, and what could be the biggest step forward in her campaign to make it the most aggressive clean energy state in US history, writes The Epoch Times.

What would she do to tackle this growing crisis in Michigan, as she prepares to launch her plan to change the way she campaigns for US elections in November? And what is her priorities and will raise her national profile?</p>
