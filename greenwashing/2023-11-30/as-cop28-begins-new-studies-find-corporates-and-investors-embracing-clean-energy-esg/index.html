    <p>When the King Charles III arrived in Dubai to attend the United Nations climate conference in 2023, he said that a trillion dollars of clean energy investments are being invested in the countrys economy. But what does it mean for Scotland to be more resilient to the threat of global warming? The BBC s Victoria Derbyshire explains. () What is it going to happen when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions, and why is the government increasing their investment in environmental policies and how it is likely to become the most important part of the world? Why is this huge amount of money spent on sustainable energy, which could be linked to global economic growth and the impact on the environment? What would it be like to invest more than three billion pounds worth of fossil fuels, as well as how the UK is taking steps to tackle the pandemic, the BBC has learned from scientists and businessmen who have been talking about how Britain is investing in an entirely clean electricity infrastructure, but what are the key factors that have led to his first visit to Dubai, in what they describe as the  clean energy  - and what is about to do, asks Richard Branson, who looks at how much it can be done to help those developing innovative technologies that are underpinning the global energy industry, writes BBC News presenter Joenia Wapixana, saying it has reached its heightened ambitions for the first time.</p>
