    <p> The Better Futures Thrive Report by Kantar and the Sustainable Business Council (SBC) emphasizes the need for New Zealand businesses to enhance their commitment to social responsibility, both internally with employees and externally within communities. The report identifies a significant gap in social sustainability actions by businesses, with only 22% of consumers believing that New Zealand companies are actively addressing community and social challenges.  The report highlights three spheres of influence in consumer perception of business social responsibility:  1. Employee perceptions: New Zealand employers are generally seen as fostering a welcoming and authentic workplace culture. However, 45% of New Zealanders have experienced discrimination at work or during job searches, often based on factors such as country of origin, culture, age, or gender. Employees prioritize tackling issues related to authenticity, social harm of a company s products, and valuing staff.  2. Societal perceptions: Kiwi consumers are most concerned about businesses  efforts to create a positive societal impact through their products, services, and community contributions. The research indicates that having a visible impact is crucial for major New Zealand businesses. Issues around diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) are influencing consumer purchasing behavior, with 22% claiming that DEI often or always impacts their purchase decisions.  3. Consumer perceptions of brands: New Zealanders are more critical of major Kiwi brands  impact on social outcomes. The research reveals that these brands are underperforming in areas such as engaging with social issues, addressing inequity, reflecting society, and community outreach. Service industry brands with more regular and visible consumer interaction are rated higher on DEI delivery.  The report suggests that New Zealanders are seeking stronger leadership from businesses to address social issues and expect more visible engagement and meaningful action on social issues. The research is based on the perspectives of 1,000 New Zealanders surveyed on social issues and responsibility, with a margin of error of ±5% points at the 95% confidence level.</p>
