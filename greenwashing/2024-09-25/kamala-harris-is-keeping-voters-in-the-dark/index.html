    <p> At this year s Climate Week NYC, liberal activists and elites are advocating for a shift from a  fossil-fuel society  to a  green economy,  claiming it will bring significant changes in building, living, and learning. However, this transition, driven by federal bureaucrats, corporate leaders, and radical activists, may inadvertently leave behind hardworking Americans and the global poor. The American Dream, built on affordable and reliable energy, is essential for reducing poverty and creating prosperity. Yet, under the Biden-Harris administration, energy prices have surged by 30%, burdening many families with monthly bills nearing $1000.  California serves as a prime example, where policies endorsed by Vice President Kamala Harris have led to electricity prices almost double the national average, resulting in power disconnections for tens of thousands of people. This situation threatens the American Dream of ownership and upward mobility, as families face eviction and insurance cancellations due to their inability to pay for utilities.  The situation is even more dire in developing nations, where millions lack access to electricity, and the number of people with access has decreased for the first time in decades. If progressive Democrats continue their agenda, more people will be trapped in poverty and darkness.  However, this crisis is self-imposed, and policymakers have the knowledge to reduce energy costs and restore the American Dream. Under the Trump administration, energy jobs were revived, the United States became an energy exporter, and families saved an average of $2500 annually. As more Americans face energy insecurity due to radical climate policies, it is ironic that Kamala Harris s energy plans for the next four years may perpetuate this issue.  Dr. Kevin Roberts, President of Heritage Action for America, highlights the need for a balanced approach to energy policies that consider the well-being of all Americans and the global poor.</p>
