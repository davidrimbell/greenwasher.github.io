    <p> Italy s antitrust agency has initiated an investigation into Infinite Styles Services CO.

Shein has its Europe, Middle East, and Africa headquarters in Dublin, while its global headquarters are in Singapore. The country s Competition and Markets Authority has written to  well-known  fashion labels, advising them to review their practices after issu</p>
