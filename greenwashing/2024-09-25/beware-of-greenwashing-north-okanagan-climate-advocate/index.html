    <p> Greenwashing is a deceptive marketing strategy employed by companies to falsely portray themselves as environmentally responsible or climate leaders. This tactic involves making unsubstantiated claims about their eco-friendly practices, while their actual operations continue to harm the environment and exacerbate climate change. The goal is to mislead consumers, investors, and the public, gaining approval for actions that contradict the public interest.  To identify greenwashing, look for signs such as grandiose promises with little evidence, vague language (e.g.,  all-natural and eco-friendly ), and claims that are difficult to verify (e.g.,  carbon-neutral by 2030 ). A 2022 Greenpeace Netherlands report, led by Harvard University researchers, found greenwashing in 72% of social media posts by oil and gas companies.  Fossil fuel companies often use greenwashing to downplay their role in the climate crisis, deny the existence of climate change, and shift their strategy to protect profits while delaying meaningful climate action. This delay compromises a livable future.  Examples of greenwashing include misleading ads on Kelowna airport s luggage carousel, which claim that BC LNG will reduce global emissions. These ads, funded by the industry lobby group Canada Action, have been deemed greenwashing by Ad Standards Canada for distorting the true meaning of statements made by professionals or scientific authorities.  Greenwashing hinders progress towards a sustainable future. However, there is hope. The Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment and partners proposed amendments to the federal Competition Act to address greenwashing. The federal government adopted these new rules in June 2024 as part of Bill C-59. Some groups have already removed misleading content from their websites and communications in anticipation of these anti-greenwashing provisions becoming law.  Being aware of greenwashing is crucial for meaningful climate action and a livable planet. It is essential to scrutinize companies  claims and hold them accountable for their environmental impact.</p>
