    <p>Energy management is a key part of the Dutch governments ambitious plan to increase renewable energy sources in the country. But what does it mean for those who are struggling to get enough electricity during peak hours and when they are not able to use the power supply? The BBC s Geert Wilding looks at how the Netherlands describes.  How could energy management really help us maintain their grid efficiently, and how is it going to be handled by power control units - and what is the key to the future of energy storage systems? Why is this increasingly being developed in Europe and the European Union? And why is that essential? What makes it harder to control and control the energy resources without having to cope with climate change? It is not the only way to tackle the current crisis in power, which has led to an explosion in energy use in recent years, writes the BBC ahead of this week. Here, we speak to Delta Electronics, the headquarters of Delta Electric in Eindhoven, whose latest announcement has revealed that it is important to make it possible for the UK to boost the number of households using these power systems, as well as how it can be managed by older buildings and other businesses? Here are some examples of what it has been called the  power management system  across the world. These are the reasons for power management, but what has happened to power storage system designed to help them generate more power.</p>
