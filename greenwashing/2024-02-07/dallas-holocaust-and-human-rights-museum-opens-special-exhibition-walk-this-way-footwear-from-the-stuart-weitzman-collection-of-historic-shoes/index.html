    <p>The Walk this Way exhibition has opened in Dallas, Texas, to celebrate the contribution of women to the world s fashion scene, including a stunning collection of shoes worn by suffragists during the 1930s and 1920s, and the impact of fashion on the US economy and consumer culture, as well as the rise of consumer cultural expansions in the 1960s.. ( Why is it really important for women? - and why is this one of the most important events in history of these shoes?) and what does it mean for those who have played their role in society and how they were weared by the women in modern history?
