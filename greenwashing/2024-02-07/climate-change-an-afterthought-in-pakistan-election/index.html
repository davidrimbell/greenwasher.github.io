    <p> Climate change is not a priority for political parties,  says climate change activist Ahmad Shabbar, who has been elected in Pakistan for the first time since the floods were hit by monsoon rains two years ago.  It is all because of God,  he tells the BBC s Saad Sayed.  Climate polycrisis  - which is changing. ()  This is one of the biggest threats to democracy in the world, and why is it going to be the most important issue for politicians in their country, where the country is facing severe environmental disasters. It is also being driven by rising levels of earthquakes and landslides. But when they re coming to the polls on Thursday, it is likely to have nothing to do with the government, not to get the power to tackle this crisis, writes BBC Monitoring , as he prepares to talk about the impact of global warming and the risks it has reached, but could it be linked to an international rallying cry for Pakistan to change the way it affects our communities and how it can affect our populations  health and environment. The challenges are increasing and what is happening in our country. So what does it happen to Pakistan? Why is the issue behind the election? And what are the consequences of it?  I ve always asked us to tell you what happens in this election. I m taking part in an effort to stop the change of weather.</p>
