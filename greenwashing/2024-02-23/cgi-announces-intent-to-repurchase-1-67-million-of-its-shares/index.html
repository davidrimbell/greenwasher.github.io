    <p>Canada s largest stock exchange has approved a private agreement with the chief executive of the company for the purchase of subordinate voting shares in directly held by his former chairman, Serge Godin, for $250m (152m) worth of cash on hand, according to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in February 23, 2024.. But  (CGI - CGI) is to announce that it is taking part in the reacquisition of its Class A Shares in Toronto, Canada, and will fund the sale from the National Bank Financial Inc. (CNW) on the stock market, in what it says is the biggest share re purchase in Canada in more than two decades. The Canadian company has agreed to buy the share of an entirely indirectly owned by its founder and Executive Chairman of his board of directors, as it prepares to sell its shares at the price of $149.6 per class A share, the value of $750m in its annual acquisition which has been rejected by the Board of Directors  advisers and financial advisors to pay for their shareholders in an attempt to reduce the risks of closing its stock markets until the end of this year, after being given the go-ahead to take over the US Treasury, US regulators have voted to be able to give immediate value to its own shareholder and the owner of one of her corporate share holders. Why is it not going to get it out of public interest in this announcement?</p>
