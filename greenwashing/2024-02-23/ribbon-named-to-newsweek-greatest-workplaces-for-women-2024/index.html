    <p>A US communications firm has been named as one of America s greatest workplaces for women, according to a report by the Newsweek and Plant-A Insights Group (Newsweek Global) and Campaign for Women (PRN) in February 23, 2024. Why is it so important for female employees to thrive in the workforce and how is the economy. () How does the company really achieve this achievement and what is being done to create an environment where women can be able to work for the first time in more than 100 years, the BBC has learned about the success of its efforts to tackle gender barriers in workplace equality and whether they are making their way to improve the quality of leadership across the world? The BBC looks at what it has accomplished when it comes to the top of the list?
