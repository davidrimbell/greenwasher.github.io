  <meta name="description" content="Honeywell, a leading technology and manufacturing company, has made a significant breakthrough in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) testing. In collaboration with Embraer, a Brazilian aerospace manufacturer, Honeywell successfully tested its HTF7500 turbofan engine on the Praetor 600 aircraft using 100% SAF. This marks the first time that 100% SAF has been flown in Honeywell&rsquo;s business jet engines.
The test compared the engine&rsquo;s performance using SAF and traditional jet fuel, and the results were impressive. The engine performed flawlessly with both fuels, demonstrating that SAF is a viable and sustainable alternative to traditional jet fuel. This breakthrough is a significant step forward in creating a more sustainable future for aviation.
Honeywell is committed to sustainability and has plans to use SAF solutions in its own engines and auxiliary power units (APUs). The HTF7500 engine powers both the Praetor 600 and Praetor 500 aircraft models, offering improved fuel efficiency and reduced noise. By incorporating SAF into their engines, Honeywell is taking a proactive approach to reducing the aviation industry&rsquo;s carbon footprint.
In another positive development, DP World, a global trade company, has raised $1.5 billion through a Green Sukuk to support its decarbonisation efforts. The Sukuk, a type of Islamic bond, will fund eligible green projects in electrification, renewable energy, clean transportation, and energy efficiency. This successful fundraising demonstrates investors&#39; confidence in DP World&rsquo;s strong sustainability focus.
DP World is committed to leading global trade into a more resilient and sustainable future. The company has set ambitious goals, aiming to become carbon neutral by 2040 and achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. By raising funds through a Green Sukuk, DP World is actively investing in projects that will contribute to a greener and more sustainable world.
Milinda Hewagama, the Group Chief Financial Officer and Head of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) of the Hayleys Group, has been appointed to the Board of the United Nations Global Compact Network Sri Lanka. With his extensive experience in financial management and planning, Hewagama is responsible for driving the Group&rsquo;s ESG Roadmap.
Hewagama believes that integrating ESG standards and targets is crucial for sustainable business models. He emphasizes the importance of good governance and ethical business management, as well as treating everyone in the organization with respect and leading with empathy. Hewagama&rsquo;s appointment to the Board reflects his commitment to advancing sustainable practices in Sri Lanka.
These recent developments highlight the importance of transparency and accountability in the pursuit of sustainability. Companies like Honeywell, DP World, and the Hayleys Group are taking concrete steps to create a more sustainable future. However, it is essential for consumers to remain vigilant and informed to avoid falling victim to greenwashing.
Greenwashing refers to the deceptive practice of misleading consumers about the environmental benefits of a product or company. It involves misrepresentation, fraud, deceit, and dishonesty, often through false advertising or misleading claims. Green marketing, eco-washing, sustainability washing, and whitewashing are all terms associated with greenwashing.
As concerned individuals, we must educate ourselves about greenwashing and hold companies accountable for their claims. By supporting companies that demonstrate genuine commitment to sustainability, we can contribute to a greener and more sustainable future for ourselves and future generations.
In conclusion, the recent advancements in sustainable aviation fuel testing, green financing, and corporate sustainability practices are encouraging. However, it is crucial to remain vigilant and discerning to avoid falling victim to greenwashing. By supporting companies that prioritize transparency and genuine sustainability efforts, we can collectively work towards leaving a better world for future generations.
