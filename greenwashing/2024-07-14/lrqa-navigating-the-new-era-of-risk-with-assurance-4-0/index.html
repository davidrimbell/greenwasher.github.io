    <p>Companies are increasingly struggling to protect their operations and reputations when they become globalised. Why are companies finding it harder for them to take a more proactive approach to risks and ensure transparency? The BBC s Larry Madowo looks at the challenges of digital technologies which could help businesses and assurers to monitor. (). How is it so hard for companies to watch and manage supply chains, and how can it be handled by those who have been involved in the globalisation of the world of cybersecurity, including climate change and the coronavirus pandemic threats? What does it mean for us to avoid further damage? And why is the risk of being exposed to the dangers of Covid-19? Should these changes be tackled by new legislation, the BBC has learned about the impact of new technology on the future of global manufacturing and business safety? Here, we look at how the technology is making it easier for the company to control themselves and protect its operations, as well as how it can be done to tackle environmental issues and what needs to be addressed by the UK government and other spending watchdog - and who makes it more difficult to cope with the rapid shift in corporate growth? How can we take action to prevent rising levels of disruption and delays across the country? It is possible to see the possibility of an increase in data collection, analysis and monitoring of its supplies chain performance and risk forecasts in recent years? Is it likely to have the right way?</p>
