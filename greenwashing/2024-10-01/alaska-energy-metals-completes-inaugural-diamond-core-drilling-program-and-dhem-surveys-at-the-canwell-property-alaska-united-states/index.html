  <meta name="description" content=" Alaska Energy Metals Corp. (AEMC) has completed drilling at the Canwell block of claims within its Nikolai Project in Alaska, targeting potential mineral deposits near the Eureka deposit. The drilling program, which included three holes totaling 1,048 meters, reached planned depths at Odie and Upper Canwell, while the Emerick prospect encountered poor ground conditions and was halted early. All core samples have been logged, cut, and sent to SGS Burnaby for analysis, with results expected later in the fourth quarter of 2024.  In addition to the drilling program, DOWNHOLE ELECTROMAGNETIC SURVEYS (DHEM) were conducted on one drill hole at the Upper Canwell prospect by TMC Géophysique of Val-d Or, Quebec. These surveys aim to identify mineralized zones around the drill holes and assist in planning future drilling. The final survey results and interpretations will be available later in the same quarter.  AEMC has also issued one million shares and paid $125,000 to the Canwell claim block owner, with an option to purchase a 100% interest in the claims. To complete the option, AEMC will need to make a further cash and share payment of $250,000 and additional exploration expenditures of approximately $1.2 million.  Gabriel Graf, AEMC s Chief Geoscientist, has reviewed and approved the technical disclosure in this news release. The company is focused on developing the Eureka deposit, which contains nickel, copper, cobalt, chromium, iron, platinum, palladium, and gold. AEMC also holds a secondary project in western Quebec.  The company emphasizes the importance of environmental performance, carbon mitigation, and responsible management of human and financial capital. Forward-looking statements in the news release are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied.
