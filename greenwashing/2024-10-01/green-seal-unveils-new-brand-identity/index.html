  <meta name="description" content=" Green Seal, a non-profit environmental certification organization, has introduced a new brand identity to combat greenwashing and assist consumers in identifying products that are safer for both people and the planet. Since its inception 35 years ago, Green Seal has been instrumental in transforming the sustainability of away-from-home products through its comprehensive certification standard, which is now being applied to the household products market.  The new identity reflects Green Seal s commitment to promoting safer and more sustainable products by focusing on core elements such as safer chemicals, responsible sourcing, low-impact manufacturing, sustainable packaging, and verified performance and claims. The organization aims to reduce marketplace confusion and enable consumers to align their purchasing decisions with their values.  According to a 2024 survey by ERM Shelton, 75% of people globally consider buying eco-friendly products an important part of their personal image, and 76% are concerned about the use of harmful chemicals. Additionally, 64% of U.S. consumers find third-party green certifications moderately to extremely important when purchasing a product.  Green Seal collaborated with brand consultancy Interbrand and gathered input from consumer-packaged goods brands, retailers, and consumers during the development of the new identity. The certification mark now includes a descriptor to educate consumers on what Green Seal certification means, which research shows improves shopper understanding of the purpose of ecolabels.  Green Seal will showcase the new brand identity at Sustainable Brands  24 in San Diego, where it will host a panel discussion on  Solving the Biggest Problem with Sustainable Products.  The organization s impacts and certified products and services can be found on their website, greenseal.org.  Green Seal-certified household products are also available on Amazon, and numerous federal, state, and institutional purchasing policies specify Green Seal and certified products as eligible for Amazon s Climate Pledge Friendly badge.
