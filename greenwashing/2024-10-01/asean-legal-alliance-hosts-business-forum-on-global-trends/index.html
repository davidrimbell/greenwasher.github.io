  <meta name="description" content=" The ASEAN Legal Alliance (ALA) and Warwick Legal Network (WLN) held their Annual Business Forum in Bangkok, focusing on law, business, and sustainability. The event, hosted at Pullman Bangkok King Power, featured discussions on ESG, digital transformation, and investment opportunities. The forum, which took place from September 26-27, 2024, was notable for being a carbon-neutral event, with Uwork999 Co., Ltd. providing sponsorship for carbon credits.  The conference began with The 2030 SDGs Game, led by Dr. Scott Smith, which challenged participants to think critically about the interconnected nature of the Sustainable Development Goals. His Excellency Chuan Leekpai, former Prime Minister of Thailand, emphasized the importance of a strong rule of law for businesses to thrive during periods of rapid transformation.  The forum included sessions on Thailand s investment opportunities, with panelists discussing investment incentives and advancements in technology and infrastructure. ALA reaffirmed its mission to support regional integration in the context of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), and its partnership with WLN strengthened its ability to assist clients globally.  The conference also highlighted the role of sustainability and technology in law, with discussions on ESG standards, AI, and digital transformation. Industry leaders shared insights on how ESG considerations are reshaping corporate governance and legal compliance.  Aloysius Wee, Managing Partner of AQUINAS Law Alliance and Chairman of the ASEAN Legal Alliance, remarked on the timeliness of the forum, emphasizing the need for legal professionals and business leaders to embrace global trends like ESG, digital transformation, and AI.  The forum concluded with discussions on actionable topics, including intellectual property in the digital age, cross-border corporate law, and sustainable real estate investment. These conversations are expected to shape the future of law and business within ASEAN and beyond."/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://green-washer.com/greenwashing/2024-10-01/asean-legal-alliance-hosts-business-forum-on-global-trends/">
