  <meta name="description" content=" John Dithfield, CEO of Harmonics, emphasized the need for significant efforts to enhance communication with savers about sustainable pensions during a Good Money Week event. Dithfield highlighted the complexity of understanding investment products, particularly in the UK where workplace schemes dominate. He pointed out that simpler products often struggle to convey complex sustainability issues.  Dithfield believes that resolving this issue requires government intervention, as the industry alone cannot address it. He mentioned that the Labour government is discussing actions around workplace pensions, but he suggested that introducing an advanced duty of care for employers to provide workplace education would be more effective.  Charlene Cranny, founder of Economy of Good, also spoke at the event, addressing the current backlash against ESG investments. She stressed the importance of having more voices championing sustainable investment and finance. Cranny suggested reassuring pension trustees by showcasing the success of similar schemes and emphasizing that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to ESG investments.  In summary, both Dithfield and Cranny emphasized the need for improved communication and education around sustainable pensions and ESG investments. They called for government action and more advocates to address the complexities and challenges faced by savers in understanding these issues."/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://green-washer.com/greenwashing/2024-10-01/industry-must-work-to-improve-communication-on-sustainable-pensions/">
