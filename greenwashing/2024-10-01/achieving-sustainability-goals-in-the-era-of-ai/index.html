  <meta name="description" content=" Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being integrated into our daily lives, with its adoption and impact becoming inevitable. In South Africa, 91% of IT leaders believe AI and GenAI will significantly transform their industries, potentially boosting productivity by 60% to 70%. However, the energy intensity of AI poses a challenge, as its adoption could lead to substantial increases in energy use and emissions, potentially hindering environmental performance targets.  To address this challenge, businesses must adopt energy-efficient infrastructure and integrate AI in a way that aligns with sustainability and energy efficiency objectives. This includes monitoring and controlling carbon footprints, reducing physical footprints, and optimizing IT environments. The adoption of the as a Service (aaS) model can also help companies manage their IT environments more efficiently, reducing energy costs and carbon footprints.  Moreover, modern devices with AI-enabled features can advance energy efficiency by adjusting performance to meet peak worktimes and extending battery life through intelligent power-saving features. Regular refresh cycles can also ensure that businesses operate with the latest energy-efficiency technology.  To fully leverage AI for sustainability, businesses must adopt a holistic approach, bringing leaders from across the organization together to collaborate and integrate AI-led strategies into every facet of their operations. This will enable them to chart a roadmap to sustainability and drive the future of work while maintaining data sovereignty and ensuring optimal return on investment."/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://green-washer.com/greenwashing/2024-10-01/achieving-sustainability-goals-in-the-era-of-ai/">
