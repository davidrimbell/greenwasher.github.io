  <meta name="description" content=" The ESG Symposium 2024, attended by over 3,500 representatives from government, private sector, and civil society, aims to expedite the transition towards a low-carbon society. The plan focuses on four key approaches: unlocking legal and regulatory barriers, promoting access to green finance, developing technology and infrastructure, and strengthening small and medium-size enterprises’ adaptability and capability. Thailand s Deputy Prime Minister, Prasert Jantararuangthong, emphasized the importance of collaboration under the ESG strategy to create a balanced economy with social and environmental governance. Thailand aims to position itself as the ASEAN center for carbon credit trading through the Thai Stock Exchange, enhancing energy security for domestic consumption and exports within ASEAN.  SCG, as a mentor, will provide support and foster cooperation between various sectors. Thammasak Sethaudom, president and CEO of SCG, highlighted the importance of developing knowledge and understanding of clean energy, promoting innovations and technologies, and establishing domestic agencies to certify standards. The Saraburi Sandbox, Thailand s first low-carbon model city, will serve as a pilot area to address policy, industrial system, and green infrastructure challenges.  In Vietnam, local authorities are preparing for a carbon credit market development scheme, with plans to establish a pilot carbon trading platform from next year. This initiative will incorporate public-private-people partnerships to implement the four proposals and create a low-carbon city in a real-world setting. The government s promotion of decentralizing decision-making and operations to local agencies will help reduce procedural steps and ambiguities in project implementation, accelerating progress across all fronts."/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://green-washer.com/greenwashing/2024-10-01/accelerating-transition-to-low-carbon-society/">
