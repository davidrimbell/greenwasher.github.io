  <meta name="description" content=" Thomas &amp; Adamson (T&amp;A), a property and construction consultancy, joined global firm Egis Group in May to address scalability challenges and expand its services in Scotland. The acquisition aligns with T&amp;A s strategic goals, particularly in the UK, and enhances its capabilities in sustainability, decarbonisation, and advisory services. Zander Muego, director of T&amp;A in the UK, highlights the opportunity for geographic expansion, technological advancement, and career growth for staff.  T&amp;A has a history dating back to 1935, with over 100 employees across Edinburgh, Glasgow, London, and the Middle East. The firm specializes in private sector projects, including hotels, residential developments, and workplace projects. T&amp;A has also ventured into the healthcare sector and decarbonisation, with a portfolio that includes the UK s first Virgin Hotel and various BT projects.  Muego s experience in the Middle East, where he worked for nine years, provided valuable insights into different project delivery methods and client relationships. Egis s ESG team and focus on AI and new technology will further strengthen T&amp;A s capabilities.  The partnership with Egis also addresses the need for regeneration in city and town centers, which have faced challenges from online shopping, Covid-19, and the cost-of-living crisis. T&amp;A is actively engaging with authorities and apprentices to grow the firm and stay true to its roots.  Overall, the acquisition by Egis Group presents a historic opportunity for T&amp;A to expand its services, enhance its technological capabilities, and maintain its core values and client relationships. The partnership aligns with the firm s ambitions in sustainability and decarbonisation, while also addressing the challenges of regenerating city and town centers."/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://green-washer.com/greenwashing/2024-10-01/construction-leader-zander-muego-on-adapting-to-thomas-adamson-historic-move-to-egis-group/">
