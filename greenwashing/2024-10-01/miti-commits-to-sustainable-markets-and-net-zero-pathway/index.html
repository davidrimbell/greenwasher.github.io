  <meta name="description" content=" The Ministry of Investment, Trade and Industry (MITI) in Malaysia has launched its Sustainability Report 2023, emphasizing the ministry s commitment to sustainable practices in the trade and industry sector. MITI s Minister, Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz, highlighted the report s focus on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues, asserting that the ministry must lead by example. The report, produced in-house and verified by third-party auditors, aims to encourage more industry players to undertake their own sustainability reporting.  The report follows the launch of MITI s National ESG Framework last year and is the first of its kind at the ministry level in the country. It showcases the ministry s industrial policy implementation, including the National Automotive Policy 2020, the National Semiconductor Strategy (NSS), and the New Industrial Master Plan 2030 (NIMP 2030).  Tengku Zafrul also emphasized the people-centric nature of the ministry s initiatives, focusing on investment, international trade, industrial development, job opportunities, and community engagement. The MITI Open Day, which highlighted these key aspects, offered over 2,600 job opportunities from more than 22 companies for graduates in attendance.  The ministry is also prioritizing the TVET training sector, with various training providers present at the event. This initiative aims to enhance business competitiveness, benefit the environment and future generations, and support Malaysia s net-zero target."/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://green-washer.com/greenwashing/2024-10-01/miti-commits-to-sustainable-markets-and-net-zero-pathway/">
