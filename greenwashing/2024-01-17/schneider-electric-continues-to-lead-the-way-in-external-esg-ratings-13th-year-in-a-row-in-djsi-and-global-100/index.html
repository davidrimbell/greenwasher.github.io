    <p>Schneider Electric has been named the world s most sustainable company in 2024, according to the latest annual corporate assessment of its performance. Why is it so important to ensure sustainability is a key factor in its efforts to tackle climate change and renewable growth in the UK and the US? These are the key takeaways from the BBC. () How is Schneider electric proud to be among the top 100 companies behind the global environmental agency Corporate Knights - and what is the company responsible for which it says it has become one of the biggest companies on the planet, and how they are making their business strategy and priorities for all of us? And how does it behave when it comes to energy and resources? The BBC has learned that the firm is now the only company to have successfully secured its place in this list. The corporation has now reached the number one spot on its top 10 list for the 13th time in an effort to improve its environment, social and economic performance, as well as how it is delivering healthy benefits to all those who have been working for it? What is that going? A row between the technology company and consumers across the country? It is not always being able to achieve enough to make it more sustainably? and is there nothing to do with it, writes the business editor Larry Madowo, who looks at why it was once again added to its global ranking of most powerful companies in his field?</p>
