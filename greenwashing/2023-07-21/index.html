  <meta name="title" content="Criticism Surrounds UN Food Systems Summit for Strengthening Corporate Control over Food Systems"/>
  <meta name="description" content="The upcoming UN Food Systems Summit &#43;2 Stocktaking Moment in Rome is facing criticism for potentially strengthening the control of industrial agriculture over food systems. The previous summit, held two years ago, failed to address the power of transnational corporations and instead promoted greenwashing initiatives. This exclusion of small-scale food producers, Indigenous Peoples groups, and social movements led to widespread criticism.
The upcoming summit is expected to further consolidate corporate control over food and natural resources, despite the fact that small farmers and sustainable practices feed the majority of the world&rsquo;s population. It is crucial for the UN to prioritize addressing structural inequalities and supporting peasant agroecology to tackle hunger, climate change, and biodiversity loss.
In the corporate world, Tri Pointe Homes, one of the largest homebuilders in the US, has released its 2022 Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) report. The report highlights the company&rsquo;s commitment to sustainability and its impact on society. Tri Pointe Homes focuses on incorporating new materials and technologies into its business practices to promote environmental responsibility. The report also emphasizes the company&rsquo;s corporate governance practices, commitment to building connected communities, and efforts to create a diverse and inclusive workplace culture. Tri Pointe Homes has received recognition for its workplace culture and has aligned its strategies with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
Moving on to state rankings, Minnesota has surpassed Texas in CNBC&rsquo;s annual state business ranking, pushing Texas out of the top five for the first time. The ranking is based on factors such as access to capital, workforce, and economy. However, CNBC&rsquo;s criteria heavily weigh environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, which favor Minnesota. For example, Minnesota scored high in life, health, and inclusion, while Texas ranked poorly. This subjective weighting raises questions about CNBC&rsquo;s agenda. Additionally, CNBC ranked Texas as the worst state to live and work in, citing reproductive rights, health, voting rights, worker protections, and inclusiveness as weaknesses. It is important to critically assess the criteria used in such rankings and consider the potential biases.
In the financial sector, big companies like BlackRock and Goldman Sachs are investing in companies that purchase single-family homes and rent them back to middle and working-class Americans. This trend is causing housing affordability to reach historic lows, with fewer homes considered affordable for the average homebuyer. This practice is transferring wealth from Main Street to the already wealthy and well-connected, hindering individuals and families from building wealth through homeownership. It is crucial to address this issue to prevent the loss of individual freedom and wealth creation opportunities.
Shifting our focus to Australia, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has released guidance on making environmental and sustainability claims. The ACCC emphasizes the importance of accuracy, evidence, and transparency in such claims. They provide examples of misleading claims and offer principles to follow, including not overstating scientific acceptance, avoiding broad claims, and being transparent about the full lifecycle of products. This guidance aligns with ASIC&rsquo;s approach to similar claims in the financial sector. It is essential for businesses to adhere to these principles to avoid penalties under the Australian Consumer Law.
Finally, shareholder activism has been a topic of discussion. While shareholder activists aim to benefit all shareholders, some employ questionable tactics that go against the fundamental spirit of shareholder activism. These tactics include engaging in undercover stock sales, self-interested financings, and using environmental, social, and governance (ESG) concerns as a cover for their true goals. It is important to critically assess the behavior of shareholder activists and ensure that their actions align with the interests of all shareholders.
In conclusion, these news summaries shed light on various aspects of greenwashing, deception, and manipulation in different sectors. It is crucial for individuals, businesses, and organizations to be aware of these issues and take steps to promote transparency, honesty, and sustainability in their practices. By doing so, we can work towards a more equitable and environmentally conscious future for ourselves and future generations.
