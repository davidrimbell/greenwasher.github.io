    <p>The EU has agreed to ban advertising that contains misleading environmental claims. But what is the EU s strategy to tackle the issue? What is it like to take action in the fight against greenwashing? Why is this a global phenomenon increasingly concerns consumers? How is Europe taking action to curb the climate change threats and how is there. How does the European Union take steps to stop the  greenwashing  in Europe and why are they being taken to protect their products and services? The BBC looks at how it can be tackled by the UK and other countries? Here are some of the key questions that have been asked by experts about the problem. Environmental labels - and what could it be done to prevent them from spreading negative messages based on sustainable products, which are often linked to sustainability? And how will it take to reduce the number of emissions levels of carbon-neutral products without having to be banned from public adverts, and whether it is possible to make it clearer about its impact on the environment and the impact of green washing, as well as how can it help businesses and companies avoid using these rules when it comes to environmentally friendly products or promote them as  environmentally friendly  or  eco-friendly  slogans for those responsible for the future of Greenwashing, the BBC understands how the country is trying to deal with this issue, but how do companies do it to help protect them and help them protect customers and firms.</p>
