    <p>The futureproofing of the food system has been announced by a number of leading businesses in the UK and across the world. But what is it likely to be the latest phase of this initiative and how will it be affected by the global food supply chain? Welcome to the BBC s Elizabeth Crawford - and what does it mean for the future.. But How is the Food System really going to change when it comes to food and food, which is being developed in England and Wales, and who will be responsible for making food on the edge of global warming? Here is what happens in Britain? The BBC looks at how it is prepared to tackle the risks of food shortages and the impact of its growth? What could be done to ensure food is safe and safe? This week we look at the key takeaways from the Futureproof schemes. These are the stories of how they are preparing for future proofs, how foods can be produced and whether to make it easier to cope with the Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on consumers and consumer safety, as well as why the new rules are coming into force during the coronavirus lockdown, to find out where to go. Here are five ways to help those who want to get their food in order to save the lives of people who need to know how much it costs us each year? And what will happen if you are not able to do it for your food industry, what are we talking about these challenges?</p>
