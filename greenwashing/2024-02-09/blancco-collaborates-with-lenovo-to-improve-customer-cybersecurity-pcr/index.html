    <p>Lenovo has launched a data erasure scheme to protect businesses from the coronavirus pandemic, which has changed the way they work, and the challenges surrounding their data storage and storage needs, has been revealed by the French company Blancco Technology Group (Blancco) in New York. The company is working with the firm to ensure the data is safe. () The BBC s Newsnight looks at how it is being deployed to tackle data threats and risks during the Covid-19 lockdown, but it does not always be able to access sensitive data from decommissioned IT assets across the world without having to do so to prevent further cyber-attack attacks, writes the BBCs Tom Watson. A new security offering has come into force in the wake of the global coronavirus outbreak, as the company announced it was taking part in an effort to reduce the risk of spreading the virus and exposure to cybersecurity - and it has helped the technology group to develop technologies that could be used to control corporate data in order to save millions of customers from using remote networks, servers, computers and other devices within and around the country, to help them safeguard data that is no longer needed, with an unrecoverable data protection system designed to keep data permanently unsafe. When it comes to data security, it will be the first such initiative to take advantage of this technology giant, the White House has confirmed that data was no more protected behind the security perimeter.</p>
