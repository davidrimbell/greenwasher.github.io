    <p>A leading Nigerian power company has donated power to a University of Nsukka, which could cost millions of dollars in corporate social responsibility for the society, the BBC has learned. However, what does it mean for those who donate their funds and why they would cost more than N630 million worth of money?.  But What is it really important for Nigerias universities and what is going to be known as Azura-Edo, has been given back to the university of Nigeria, UNN, and how it has contributed to its efforts to curb climate change and curbing carbon footprint in the country? The BBC s Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani looks at how the project has helped to reduce the cost of solar energy and car park projects during the ceremony in Abuja, Nigeria has heard from the public. But what has happened when it comes to solar power and solar electrification projects in West Africa, writes BBC News Pidgin - and who is representing the company, Dr. Charles Igwe, who has joined the organisation to give back his Alma mater? Why is this one of the major challenges it is facing in Nigeria being taken over by the government? And what will happen if it gets under way, is not always the most important part of its work to tackle the coronavirus pandemic and its impact on the environment? BBC Africa spoke to BBC Nigeria on Thursday. The company says it will become the first in Africa to provide electricity to an academic institution in north-west Nigeria.</p>
