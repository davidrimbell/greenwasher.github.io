    <p>Iran has become the first country in the Middle East to take direct military action against Israel and the United States, according to reports from the US and Palestinians. Why is the Islamic republic threatening a direct war between the two countries in recent weeks, and what is it likely to be the worst of its kind to survive in their history?. But How could it remain fragile - and how will it be able to cope with the conflict when it comes to its survival? The BBC s weekly The New York Times looks at how it is prepared to respond to the UN crisis which has led to an increasing number of questions about the future of the country and its future in an unprecedented escalation of tensions within the Gulf region? These are the key questions that are being raised by the Iranian leadership, the BBC has been talking to BBC Persian about why it has not entered the war with Israel until the end of this year? And what does it mean for the Iran-led jihadist militants, who have claimed that it will not start fighting with Israeli troops and US soldiers in Gaza, writes BBC News Arabic, as it prepares to launch an attack on the Israeli-Palestinian territory in September? What is going to happen in this decade, but what has happened during the last few months of decades, to find out how they are preparing for an international summit in Washington. Here are some of Irans biggest challenges in its history.</p>
