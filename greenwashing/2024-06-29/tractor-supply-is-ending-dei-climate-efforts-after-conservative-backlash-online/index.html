    <p>One of the world’s biggest retailers has announced that it will withdraw from its carbon emissions targets, in a move which has sparked legal attacks against the firm s diversity and inclusion efforts in the US state of Tennessee, Ohio, and Arizona, US officials say, as they clashed with the Supreme Court in May. (). But The company says it is ending its environmental and social engagement effort. Why is it going to leave these goals and will stop sponsoring non-business activities, it has been revealed by the BBC. The BBC has learned that the company will not focus on climate change, but does it do more to tackle human rights campaigns and campaign programmes. A leading US retailer has said it wants to change its policy and message of how it approaches its own carbon emission schemes, after weeks of online conservative backlash and litigation that has targeted businesses across the United States during the past two years and is facing an increasing number of legal battles over their actions. But why is this shift in policy - and what is the way it deals with those involved in campaigning for LGBTQ&#43;, gay and gay people and women-owned firms that are being criticised for taking advantage of social and environment laws? Should it be removed from the greenhouse gas and water conservation initiatives for the first time in more than two decades? The chief executive of Ttractor Supply has confirmed the move.</p>
