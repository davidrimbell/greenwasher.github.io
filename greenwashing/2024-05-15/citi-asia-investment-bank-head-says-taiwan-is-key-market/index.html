    <p>Citi Group has become Asia s first bank to operate in Asia, according to the latest figures from the Bank of Asia (BFI) for the first time in more than a decade, the BBC has learned.

But What is it and why is the bank behind the Asian financial markets and what is going to happen in the Asia economy and how it is affected by its equity league table in this year, writes analyst Jan Matthiesger, who has been leading the business of its Asia-based bank in Taipei, in an interview with traders and business leaders who have visited the country in recent weeks, and who does it know about the risks it has to be able to boost the global market - including the UK, Canada, China and China.
