    <p>The role of corporate trustees in sustainable finance has been urged by the Treasury and Financial Conduct Authority (Fed) for a collective effort to tackle climate change and economic inequality, according to the country’s chief financial officer, Emomotimi Agama. Corporate trustes are being encouraged to evolve beyond. () The annual sustainability conference in Lagos, Nigeria, is taking place on Monday, the BBC has learned, but experts have called for them to change their role as intermediaries and act as guidance and gatekeepers of the environment and social responsibility.
