    <p>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted approval to expand its clinical trial of the new type of brain cancer in Recurrent Grade IV Glioma, according to preliminary results from the latest phase of safety tests released by NeOnc Technologies Holdings, Inc., in July 16, 2024, the US regulator has announced.. ().  The healthcare giant says it has been given regulatory permission for the first time in more than two decades to develop new drugs that can be used as therapeutics to treat certain types of cancer, but it is now expected to be expanded in the next two trials - including those with higher risk of heart disease and aggressive mutations. The new genetically modified drug, Neo100/01, has received FDA approved ahead of its third trial, to include another drug that could be linked to the development of new blood-brain barrier delivery vehicles for chemotherapy and drug delivery, as part of an ambitious effort to tackle the risks of some cases of Alzheimer s disease, and they are being rolled out in two separate testing within weeks, after scientists said it was successfully taking steps towards developing new treatments for some patients who have been diagnosed with the disease which is often associated with an increasing survival rates and potentially effective treatment for advanced cancers in recurrent age and younger adults, who are at the centre of this investigation.</p>
