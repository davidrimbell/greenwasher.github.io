    <p>Chanel has become the first fashion brand in the world to take a step closer to China’s art scene. But what does it mean for its success in commercial terms and how it is making it easier for it to attract audiences and promote luxury goods from the outside world? The BBC s Stephanie Hegarty looks at how the brand is to operate. But What is the iconic exhibition of Gabrielle Cannes inspired by the French fashion label has been described as the most successful initiative in its history, and what is it likely to be the focus of its efforts to boost sales in China? Why is this one of the biggest fashion brands in Europe and North Asia, which appears to have been taking its first appearance in Shanghai in July, is not always the best way to achieve its ambitious ambitions for the Chinese culture? And how could it be able to influence the fashion industry in Chinese art? What makes it possible to make it more profitable in this decade, writes Julie Gayet, who explains what it has learned about the way it deals with contemporary art in Beijing, as well as why they are increasing investment to help restore the cultural landscape of China. When it launched its touring show at Shanghai Museum of Contemporary Art in May, it will be more nuanced than when it comes into the business? It is an opportunity to find out where it can be used to sell their famous artworks, but how can it achieve the success of this new partnership? Is it so important?</p>
