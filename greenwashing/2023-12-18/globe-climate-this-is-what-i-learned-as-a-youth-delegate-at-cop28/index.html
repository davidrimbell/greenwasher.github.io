Here are some of the latest reports from around the world, including climate change, water crisis and a huge number of wildfires across Canada. This is the full list of those we catch up on this week. The BBC s Justin Bieber looks at what you think about. () What is in the new year and what is it likely to be the most important news of this year, and weve been talking to you about the impact of global warming, environment and resources in Canada and how they are affecting the environment in their coming years. What are the key topics in our new weekly bulletins? This article contains graphic images from the UK and Canada, from Canada to Canadians who have visited us in recent years and you might find out where you are going to see these updates on the planet.
