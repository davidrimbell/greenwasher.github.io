    <p>Its hard for companies to hide their dirty secrets about climate change, but experts say Canada is falling behind. Why is it getting harder for them to disclose the key questions they need to answer? The BBC s weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world, including a former Bank of Canada governor,. But  What is Canada going to be the latest in the global warming crisis, and why is the country increasingly failing to report environmental measures and how much financial risk it is facing is being put on hold. What does it mean for businesses to find out what is happening and what makes it hard to know about the risks of rising levels of greenhouse gas emissions and whether it can be reached when it comes to change the way the industry is prepared to make it more easier for firms in developing countries to keep up with the new rules that could help them avoid threats from wildfires, droughts or floods? Where are the companies coming to the pollutants that are likely to get involved in global disclosure laws, as the BBC looks at how Canada has become the first country to take action in its efforts to tackle the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and its impact on the environment? And how would it be done to protect investors from the dangers it has been having to deal with - and who is at risk of putting themselves out of this huge challenges?</p>
