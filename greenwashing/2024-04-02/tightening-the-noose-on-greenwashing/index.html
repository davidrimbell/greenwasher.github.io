    <p>Greenwashing is a serious crime, which could be referred to as the  green sheen  of the world s biggest corporations. But is it really possible that they are unmasked for evidence-based reporting of their ambitious environmental sustainability targets? What is the truth and why is such claims being made? Why is this threat? BBC News presenter Ed Butler explains how it can be done to tackle climate change and the impact of greenwashing - and how does it affect the environment and its impact on human society, and what makes it harder for companies to avoid it? The BBC looks at some examples of how many companies are using the phony green washing in the face of global warming efforts to stop the destruction of carbon emissions and protect themselves from the dangers of its failures when it comes to carbon neutrality and whether it is possible to make it clearer and more accurately against those who claim it has been taken to the wrong way to protect the company? Here is what happens in Silicon Valley, New York, London and Washington DC, writes David Robson, who has told the BBC about the risks and consequences of Greenwash while looking at how the firms are trying to achieve sustainable growth without making mistakes, asks Michael Madden, the editor of The Economist, David Cameron, to find out what is happening during the pandemic? And what are the reasons for the behaviour of companies behind the scandal?</p>
