    <p> The recent altercation between Senator Adams Oshiomhole and Edo State s First Lady, Mrs. Betsy Obaseki, exemplifies the escalating trend of personal attacks and toxic language in politics. This incident reflects a broader issue where politicians resort to mudslinging to undermine their opponents, regardless of the consequences to their own reputations.  The controversy began when Mrs. Obaseki introduced Mrs. Ifeyinwa Ighodalo, the wife of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, Asue Ighodalo, during a campaign event. Oshiomhole, who had previously insulted a widow during his governorship, responded by questioning Mrs. Obaseki s marital status and childbearing capabilities. He suggested that the PDP candidate was the only one with a wife and criticized the First Lady for not having children.  Oshiomhole s comments were widely condemned as insensitive and demeaning towards women. Many were shocked by the extent of his remarks, which drew the ire of APC supporters and the Edo Salvation Group (ESG), which demanded an apology from Oshiomhole.  The incident highlights the growing trend of politicians using foul language and personal attacks to distract from more pressing issues such as healthcare, governance, and economic challenges. It also underscores the need for politicians to refrain from engaging in such behavior, which only serves to tarnish their own image and undermine the seriousness of their campaigns.  Whether Oshiomhole will apologize to Mrs. Obaseki remains uncertain. However, his previous apologies to a widow and Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu suggest that he may be willing to make amends for his past actions. Regardless, the altercation serves as a reminder of the importance of maintaining respect and dignity in political discourse, and the need for politicians to focus on substantive issues rather than resorting to personal attacks.</p>
