    <p> Nizam Khalyd, the sixth right in a group photo with SEA members during the AGM, has been re-elected as Sarawak Entrepreneur Association (SEA) president for the term 2024 to 2026. His re-election signifies the continuation of his efforts to drive the growth and success of Sarawak s entrepreneurial community. The recent Annual General Meeting featured presentations from industry experts, including discussions on AI, InvestSarawak, e-invoicing, and ESG practices.  Nizam expressed his honor in being re-elected and highlighted the tremendous recovery within the entrepreneurial community. His focus for the upcoming term includes creating more opportunities for members, improving access to resources, and ensuring the voice of Sarawak entrepreneurs is heard at all levels. He aims to build a business ecosystem that promotes innovation, collaboration, and sustainability.  Nizam s goals for the term include expanding business recovery programs, supporting the digital transformation of SMEs, and strengthening partnerships with government bodies to assist entrepreneurs in overcoming market challenges. He also plans to align his agenda with Sarawak s Post Covid-19 Development Strategy (PCDS) 2030.  Nizam voiced concerns regarding the recent implementation of e-invoicing in Malaysia, acknowledging the potential benefits but also highlighting the challenges faced by SMEs in adapting to the new system.  During his previous term, SEA has fostered collaboration among entrepreneurs, provided valuable training opportunities, and advocated for policy changes that benefit local businesses. The association remains a crucial platform for entrepreneurs across the state, providing support, networking opportunities, and advocacy for local business interests.  Nizam s re-election marks the continuation of his efforts to drive the growth and success of Sarawak s entrepreneurial community, with a focus on innovation, collaboration, and sustainability. The association is well-positioned to continue playing a key role in shaping the future of entrepreneurship in Sarawak.  (Word count:</p>
