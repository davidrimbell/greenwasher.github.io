The complaints specifically target various campaigns and initiatives by companies in the fossil fuel industry. One such campaign is the &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s Clear the Air&rdquo; ad campaign by the Pathways Alliance group of oilsands companies. This campaign aims to portray the companies as environmentally responsible, despite their contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. Similarly, Enbridge Gas and the Canadian Gas Association have been accused of depicting natural gas as a &ldquo;clean&rdquo; energy solution, despite its significant carbon footprint.
The complaints also address the financing of fossil fuel projects by RBC, one of Canada&rsquo;s largest banks. Environmentalists argue that these claims and actions do not align with the companies&#39; commitment to fighting climate change.
