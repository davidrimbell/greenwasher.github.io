    <p>Environmental, social and governance is a key factor in the middle market s sustainability strategy, according to the latest report from Baker Tilly. But why should companies be transparent with their environmental assessments? Why is it important to understand the risks of public companies being trickling down and impacting the Middle market? What is the impact of sustainable growth. () How is this really important for companies to ensure they are clearer and transparent about the environment and climate threats that are affecting supply chains, and how could the industry be able to tackle these challenges? The BBC looks at some of the key questions that remain to be answered by the BBC. What does it mean for those who are struggling to meet the demands to protect and protect themselves from rising emissions and carbon neutrality - and what needs to take on the business? Is it essential to look at how the company is prepared to make it more competitive? And how should it be regulated? How should the UK become the first major markets to provide transparency to its annual reporting initiatives and the way it can be tackled by public company managers and business leaders when it comes from public firms who need to report on greenhouse gases, energy efficients or renewable energy and environment targets, as well as how it is likely to affect the mid market, how will the world be affected and whether the firm is privately held or not, in order to improve the market economy and its impact on businesses?</p>
