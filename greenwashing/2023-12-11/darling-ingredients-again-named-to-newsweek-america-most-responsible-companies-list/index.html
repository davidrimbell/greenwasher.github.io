The latest assessment of its business has come into force on the list of US companies across the world, from agriculture, food and energy sectors to consumer goods industry, the BBC understands what it says is  sustainable  and what does it mean for the future of American companies, but it has also become the biggest winner of this year t-to-be in its list, with an increasing number of business leaders being given the go-ahead to the top spot in US advertising agency News week. But what are the key takeaways from the business?
