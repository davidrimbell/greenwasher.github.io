    <p>In Latin American societies, diversity is often a significant factor in their role as the mainstay of the family. But in modern, open, liberal and liberal society, women are increasingly underrepresented in governments and corporations. Why are they so important to be represented in the process of making decisions, writes the BBC s Geeta. () How is it really important for those who appear to have the same identity as women, and what does it mean for the political and social mobility of women? The BBC looks at why these remarks have been revealed during the past few years, but when it comes to the issue of gender, gender and origin, in Latin America, it is the most important evidence that women have become the dominant minority in politics, politics and politics? They are not always able to carry out certain changes in order to achieve equal representation in some cases, as well as in other ways, for many of them, who have had the right to take part in public elections, or being given explicit recognition of its importance in decision-making? What is this explains - and how could it be based on the idea of what is happening to them? And where is there enough to make it harder for them to represent each other? It is hard to find out how it can be used to tackle the issues of race, origin and gender? This is an interesting question that has emerged in recent years. In the US, there are more diverse types of choices for women.</p>
