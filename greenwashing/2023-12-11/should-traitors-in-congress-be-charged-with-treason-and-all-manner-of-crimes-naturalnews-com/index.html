    <p>The US House of Representatives is being charged with treason for giving aid and comfort to enemy invaders, according to a report by Andrew Wallace, who has written an article in depth about the crisis between the two parties in the US Senate. The BBC s Larry Madowo looks at why they are guilty of crimes. () What is it actually known as the Treason against the Trump administration and their political rivals, and what is the most serious threat to Americans to return to the United States, writes the BBC News With Views on the issue of the conflict which has escalated across the country in recent weeks. This article explains how the majority of Congress and Congress have been accused of all manner of criminal abuse and deprivation of American citizenship, but could the government be able to charge them with the same reasons as those who remain in Congress, as well as other Republicans and US congressmen. They are among the main opposition to President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden. But what does it mean for them? Why is Congress - and will it be the answer to this question? The Supreme Court has said it is not the only way to call them out and accuse them for the first time in US history. Here is what it will be done to stop them from carrying out illegal acts of terrorism during the war. It is an increasing number of charges that have taken place in Washington and Washington DC. What makes them justice?</p>
