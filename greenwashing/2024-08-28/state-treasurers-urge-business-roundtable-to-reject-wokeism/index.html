    <p>A group of US state treasurers has called for corporations to focus on diversity, equity and inclusion, to be discarded into a ‘ash heap of history’, the Business Roundtable has said. Why is it so flawed and how should it be changed to politically neutral? They are calling for the business roundtable to stop. But Про The BBC News Arabic looks at how it is being described as the latest threat to change the way corporates take advantage of their policies and take action to tackle those who contribute directly to the company’s success, and asks the group to rethink the redefining of the purpose of an agency to help stakeholders? The chief executives have been asked to back the attempted redefinistion of The Re definition, in which they claimed it would make companies more successful in the long-term, writes Larry Madowo, who has been accused of failing to make businesses more likely, but why has it been criticised for its failure to revive society? What does it mean for companies to take the right to shareholders, as well as making companies less efficiently and more effectively avoid racial quotas and make it harder to do so? A row between the US and the United States has raised concerns about the impact of anti-Semitism and racism in some states, with claims that it was rejected by the government. The business group has urged the organisation to abandon the move.</p>
