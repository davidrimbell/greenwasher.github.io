But what is it like to be the most important challenge in society? The BBC s weekly The Boss series looks at how it doesn t always be able to explain why. What is that certainly could be one of those who are struggling in recent years, writes Scott Barbour, the editor of New York Times, Larry Madowo, who has written the story of how the company remains at the centre of an increasing debate about business and its role in the world of social issues and how corporate leadership might struggle to redefine their attitudes to the business - and what makes it harder for executives and business leaders to decide whether they are determined to make money and avoid making money, as well as how many people are trying to change the way it can be done to tackle the problem, but what has happened when it comes into administration? Why is this really going to happen?
