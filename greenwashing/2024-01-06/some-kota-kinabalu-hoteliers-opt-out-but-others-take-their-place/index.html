    <p>Hotel owners in Malaysia are calling on the government to impose tourism tax on their affordable accommodation schemes, as the coronavirus pandemic continues to affect the business sustainability of the city s hotel industry, the BBC has learned. Why is this threatening the economy and why is it being treated as an unfair advantage to the hotel market?.
