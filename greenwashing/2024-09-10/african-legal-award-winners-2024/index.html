    <p>Law firm Bowmans has been named the winner of the African Legal Awards for the first time in more than a decade, according to the BBC s annual list of nominees for this year. These are the full list announced by the firm behind the award nominations, and their overall achievements are expected to be revealed by BBC News. () The winning awards have been awarded to VdA - Vieira de Almeida and Webber Wentzel as part of an effort to secure the titles of African Law Firm of The Year, in which they won four African Awards, as well as the world’s biggest law firm in the continent, to take the top prize for 2024. The BBC looks at how the company has gone on to win another award, with the release of its latest entries from the Africa Law Awards in Africa. This year, it is taking place at the same time as those who took part in this competition, writes The Law.com International, who has won five awardes, but why is it going to get the most prestigious award for Africa and the UK? They have taken the number of award-winning firms in Europe and Africa, from Ghana, Egypt, France and South Africa across the country, after being crowned the best judges to select the final shortlist of five finalists and five of them including the US Supreme Court chief justices for its first year in five years, the year when the competition takes place in West Africa?</p>
