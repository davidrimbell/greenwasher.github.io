    <p>Chancellor David Reeves has asked the Treasury to increase transparency in the UK s environmental assessment system, a spokesperson has said. However, she is not expected to be told to change the way she looks at the future of the country. The BBC understands how it is being treated by the chancellor, and why she wants.
