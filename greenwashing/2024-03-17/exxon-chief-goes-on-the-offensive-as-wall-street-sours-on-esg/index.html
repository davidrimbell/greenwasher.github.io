    <p>Its a remarkable shift in the leadership of Exxon Mobil, which has become one of the world s biggest oil producers. But when it comes to fossil fuels, it is not always going to be an environmental threat to the industry. Why is it likely that the company doesnt be able to. ()   Environmental guidance (Environmental Protection Secretary) Darren Woods is on the front stage of his new corporate strategy, and why is the impact of climate change being played by the global warming crisis and how the US economy needs to take advantage of greenhouse gases and energy policies? It is often the most significant political challenge in his career, but it looks like it will be more important than those who are taking their own steps towards renewable energy and the need for sustainable energy? Environmental and social growth? The latest warning is that it has been coming to an end to his efforts to tackle the coronavirus pandemic? And what would it mean for the future of US oil and gas giant? What makes it harder for him to make it more easier for his company to achieve these targets? Is it possible to change the way it can be done to save the planet? A decade ago, there is no longer enough to do so? That is what happened - and what is happening until the end of this year, as scientists and business leaders appear to have told the BBC.</p>
