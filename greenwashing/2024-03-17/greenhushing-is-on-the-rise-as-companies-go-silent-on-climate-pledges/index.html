    <p>The latest headlines from the US and Canada have been telling us they are going on the greenhushing bandwagon, but what does it mean for companies to be responsible for climate change and their environmental policies? The BBC s weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world, including the BBCs Chris Evans.  () How is the trend to take steps towards sustainability in the past few years, and how is it likely to become a threat to the economy and the future of the global warming - and what is behind those claims that businesses are doing nothing to tackle the impact of greenhouse gas emissions and whether it is not sustainable? Why are the companies increasingly failing to defend themselves, writes the New York Times newspaper, in which scientists say it could be the biggest cause of an extinction campaign, as well as reports about the risks of rising levels of carbon dioxide and air pollution across the country? What makes it harder for them to do so, asks David Robson, who looks at why these companies have failed to make it clearer about how to protect the environment and make them look like the  greenwashing  campaigns, from warnings that some of them would have to stop being driven by activists and politicians. But what has happened when it comes to greenwashing, or where it can be seen as an environmentally friendly product, with renewable impacts?</p>
