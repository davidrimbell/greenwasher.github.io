    <p>The world s biggest mining company has released a report on its sustainability strategy. The company says it has achieved strong safety and environmental improvements in the areas of environment, social and governance - including the loss of time injury frequency rate (0.6). The latest report shows the company’s approach to sustainable growth in 2023.
