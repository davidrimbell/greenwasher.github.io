But, some companies are still being dishonest. Shell is being called out for saying their bio-LNG plant is good for the environment. They are buying biogas companies to look green. We need to be careful and hold companies responsible for lying.
Regulations are getting stricter to stop greenwashing. Companies must prove their green claims with data and diverse teams. They should be honest in their communication and get third-party certifications.
New technology is changing how we trade commodities. Platforms like Savala and DComm Blockchain are making trading more transparent and green. This helps with responsible sourcing and getting more people involved.
Consumers need to watch out for greenwashing. By choosing truly green products and supporting honest brands, we can make the marketplace more eco-friendly. This will lead to a better, greener future.
