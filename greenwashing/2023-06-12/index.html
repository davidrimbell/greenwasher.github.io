  <meta name="title" content="Companies Pledging Net-Zero Emissions Lack Credible Plans, Report Finds"/>
  <meta name="description" content="A report published on Monday reveals that many companies pledging to cut their greenhouse gas emissions to &ldquo;net zero&rdquo; lack a credible plan to achieve this goal. The concept of net zero aims to stop adding planet-warming gases to the atmosphere by preventing emissions or removing an equivalent amount through natural or technological means. While the number of companies aiming for net zero has increased, less than 5% of those examined in the report passed the checklist for credible efforts. The report highlights the need for clearer definitions and more transparent targets to avoid greenwashing and ensure meaningful progress towards global net-zero emissions.
An American Airlines pilot has filed a lawsuit against the company over sustainable funds offered in his 401(k) retirement plan. The lawsuit raises questions about the brokerage window that allows participants to invest outside the limited menu of investments offered by their employers&#39; plans. The suit claims that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by offering sustainable funds that pursue leftist political agendas. This lawsuit is significant because it concerns one of America&rsquo;s largest pensions and may affect the plan&rsquo;s self-directed brokerage account option. The suit comes as political criticism against ESG and sustainable investing has increased.
Greenpeace, ReCommon, and 12 Italian citizens are planning to file a lawsuit against ENI, Italy&rsquo;s largest energy company, claiming that the company has known about the harmful effects of fossil fuel burning since 1970 but continued to encourage extraction. The plaintiffs are seeking an injunction to compel ENI to update its decarbonization strategy and for the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) to adopt a climate policy in line with the Paris Agreement. This lawsuit is part of a growing trend of individuals and shareholders taking legal action against companies and governments for climate change-related issues.
The push for ESG policies is negatively impacting retirement accounts, as portfolios are being filled with &ldquo;woke&rdquo; investments. Mega-money managers like BlackRock are pressuring businesses to focus on progressive causes, even if it goes against their customers and investors. Americans are turning to physical precious metals to protect their savings, but there are risks associated with rollover and transfer accounts. Many companies in the industry offer a single path to their customers, but Genesis Gold Group differentiates itself by offering expert guidance and a personalized approach. It is important to work with a company that prioritizes the best interests of their clients and protects their savings.
Conservative critics of ESG investing are facing opposition from both the Left and the Right. Democratic Senators Sheldon Whitehouse, Brian Schatz, and Martin Heinrich criticized Republican officials for opposing financial institutions with anti-fossil-fuel policies. On the other hand, American Affairs senior editor Julius Krein argued that ESG is an extension of shareholder primacy, which conservatives believe in. Both sides accuse anti-ESG critics of undermining free-market principles. The convergence of the Old Left and New Right is also seen in their support for a low-carbon economy and clean energy. However, Krein does not mention the role of the United Nations in the origins of ESG.
A survey conducted by the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) has found that exchanges are increasingly adopting sustainability principles and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives. The average number of ESG initiatives pursued by exchanges has risen from 8.4 to 9.2, and the number of exchanges engaging in at least 12 initiatives has doubled. Twelve exchanges have adopted net-zero targets, and 70% of respondents have implemented initiatives that align with the WFE&rsquo;s principles. The survey also revealed that over half of exchanges are reporting their own carbon emissions. Challenges to ESG engagement include resource constraints, unreliable data, and a lack of reporting standards.
A report has shown that the number of fossil fuel companies committing to net-zero emissions targets has increased significantly in the past year. However, most of these targets fail to address key concerns and are considered &ldquo;largely meaningless&rdquo;. The report highlights that many targets do not cover or lack transparency on Scope 3 emissions, which include the use of a company&rsquo;s products and are the largest source of emissions for fossil fuel companies. Additionally, the report found that none of the companies were making commitments to move away from fossil fuel extraction or production.
Shipowners and ship operators are increasingly considering wind propulsion as a solution to decarbonize the shipping industry. Advanced wind technology, using engineering, material science, computer modeling, and automation, is being developed to reinvent wind propulsion for modern ships. Examples include the Oceanbird, a wind-powered vessel with adjustable wing sails, and the WISAMO inflatable wing sail developed by Michelin. Norsepower&rsquo;s rotor sails have also been successful in stabilizing ships and reducing fuel consumption. Wind propulsion offers a sustainable and cost-effective alternative to traditional fuels, and with the support of organizations like DNV, wind-assisted propulsion could become mainstream in the shipping industry.
Cobalt prices are expected to continue declining in the near future due to a decrease in demand from the electric vehicle (EV) battery sector and increased global production. The sale of new energy vehicles (NEVs) in China, which accounts for 40% of the cobalt market, has also decreased. Additionally, the demand for cobalt in consumer electronics is expected to remain low due to the global economic slowdown. The preference for reduced-cobalt or cobalt-free battery chemistries is also expected to drive prices down in the long term, as concerns about cobalt mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo increase.
Texas has passed a bill that prohibits insurers from considering environmental, social, or governance (ESG) criteria when setting insurance rates. The bill, Senate Bill 833, still allows insurers to consider factors relevant to the risk being insured, but insurers have criticized the bill as an overreach that could complicate the insurance marketplace. The bill is part of a broader effort by the Republican Party to limit the effectiveness of ESG measures. If the bill becomes law, it could have implications for insurers doing business in Texas and potentially impact their ability to work with reinsurers who support ESG policies.
In conclusion, the fight against greenwashing and the push for sustainable practices continues to be a complex and evolving issue. From companies failing to meet credible net-zero targets to lawsuits against energy giants, the battle for transparency and meaningful progress towards a sustainable future is ongoing. The impact of ESG investing on retirement accounts and the opposition it faces from both sides of the political spectrum further highlights the challenges and debates surrounding this issue. However, there are also positive developments, such as the increasing adoption of sustainability principles by exchanges and the exploration of wind propulsion as a solution for decarbonizing the shipping industry. As consumers and investors, it is important to stay informed and hold companies accountable for their actions to ensure a greener and more sustainable world for future generations.
