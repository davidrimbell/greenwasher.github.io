  <meta name="description" content="Major Financial Institutions Invest Billions in Bitcoin Mining, Contradicting Climate Commitments
A new report by Greenpeace USA has revealed that major financial institutions, including BlackRock, Fidelity, Vanguard, CitiGroup, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Visa, Mastercard, and American Express, have collectively invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin mining. This investment contradicts their climate commitments and the demands of science and justice.

The report also highlights the contradiction between these companies&#39; sustainability commitments and their investments in Bitcoin. It raises questions about their true dedication to combating climate change and promoting a sustainable future.

The event highlighted Hong Kong&rsquo;s strengths as an international business hub and featured a Hong Kong Night Cocktail Reception for networking and exploring business opportunities.

Top Ten States with Most Carbon-Intensive Economies Identified
The top ten states with the most carbon-intensive economies in 2020 and 2021 were Wyoming, West Virginia, Louisiana, North Dakota, Alaska, Kentucky, Mississippi, Indiana, Montana, and Arkansas. These states have resource-rich economies and smaller populations, contributing to their high carbon emissions per capita.
Despite the decrease in carbon dioxide emissions during the pandemic, the oil and gas sector in the United States plans to expand production, which contradicts the need to reduce emissions. Carbon offsets are also ineffective in reducing emissions, and the US has seen an increase in oil and gas exports due to the conflict in Ukraine.

Lab-Grown Diamond Symposium Emphasizes Value and Collaboration
Participants at the Lab-Grown Diamond Symposium in Dubai agreed that lab-grown diamonds need to find their own place in the market and not be seen as an alternative to natural diamonds. The industry must focus on creating value and differentiating lab-grown diamonds through design, creativity, and branding.
Lab-grown diamonds are expected to enter the fashion jewelry market more quickly than the engagement ring market. The symposium also highlighted the need for the lab-grown sector to broaden its focus beyond climate action and communicate other good works. The relationship between natural and lab-grown diamonds should be collaborative rather than hostile.
