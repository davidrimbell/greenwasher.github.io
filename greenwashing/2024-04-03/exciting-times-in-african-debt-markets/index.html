    <p>South Africa s debt markets are continuing to attract new funding, according to a report by the leading banking group Absa Group. Here, we look at the impact of the South African equity market and how the continent is attracting new investment in the global marketplace. Why is it so important for investors and why is the country increasingly struggling. But BBC News from BBC Africa looks at its growth prospects, and what does it mean for the future of Africa and the wider continent, as well as how it is likely to be worth billions of dollars each year, writes the Bank of England chief financial officer Christine Blasey, who has spent more than two decades investigating the risks facing those who are taking part in their efforts to boost the international economy? The BBC explains what it says is being seen as the first major investment destination in Africa, but what has happened when it comes to the business of international investment, the BBC has learned from the Asian Treasury - and it has been revealed by analysts and business leaders looking at how South Afrika is prepared to take advantage of this opportunity to invest in international companies. The latest findings suggest that the region is now getting ready to launch new projects which will be invested in major projects, in particular infrastructure and energy-security projects in recent years, to find out what is happening in its own way to make it more efficiently and more effectively than any other country, with the possibility of an increase in investment.</p>
