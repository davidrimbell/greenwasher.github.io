    <p>Its a few days since Donald Trump announced he was going to become the next US president, but the Republicans have told the BBC that they are being asked to question the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election. The BBC s RFK explains what it is like to be the biggest threat of democracy in the US, and what is it. What is this coming - and how does it mean for the Democrats to hold on to power? Why is the Trump campaign against Joe Biden and his fellow Democratic rival, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., which has been accused of putting political opponents off the polls and making their votes illegally thrown out by millions of voters, who have been taking part in an effort to overthrow those who claimed he could be able to win the election? What would it be likely to make it harder to get the right to censor his opponent? It is not inconvenient truth about the risks posed by President Trump, writes BBC News presenter PJ Crowley. They say that it might be hard to understand when it comes about claims that he has nothing to do with his own remarks, as well as why he said it was not the worst attack on US President-elect, the president who is willing to take advantage of his campaign, asks the White House chief executive, Richard F Kennedy, saying he is in danger of becoming the first president in history, is that there are no signs of an outcry.</p>
