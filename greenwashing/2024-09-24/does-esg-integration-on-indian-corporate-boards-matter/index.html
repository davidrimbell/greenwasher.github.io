    <p> The National Conference on  Responsible Business Conduct: Escalating ESG for Viksit Bharat  highlighted the evolving corporate governance landscape in India, particularly the integration of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors into boardrooms. Despite progress, there is still a long way to go in fully incorporating ESG into corporate strategies.  The conference emphasized that ESG is not just a non-financial reporting aspect but a crucial financial disclosure, as ESG-positive companies attract sustainable investments. The concept of ESG has shifted from a buzzword to a core component of modern business strategies, with companies recognizing the importance of responsible business practices beyond mere compliance.  Initiatives like the Sustainable Business Leadership Forum have underscored the significance of ESG factors, showing that companies with strong ESG credentials are better equipped to handle risks and opportunities. However, challenges persist, such as the inconsistency of ESG information, with financial reports not always reflecting a company s sustainability efforts.  The renewable energy sector in India serves as a positive example, with companies like Tata Power and Adani Green Energy setting high standards in sustainable practices. Looking ahead, integrating ESG into corporate boards in India is expected to gain more traction as the country works towards its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  To address the challenges of ESG integration, a collaborative effort is required among companies, investors, regulators, and civil society to create solid ESG frameworks, enhance data transparency, and implement effective sustainability practices. The Indian government is also taking steps to make ESG reporting a norm, with mandates for top listed companies to submit Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reports (BRSR).  In conclusion, integrating ESG into Indian corporate boards is progressing, with challenges remaining. However, there is a strong sense of optimism as businesses, investors, and policymakers work together to weave sustainable and responsible practices into India s business landscape.
