    <p>The BMA has appointed a new chief executive to help guide the industrys sustainability and environmental engagements, the BBC has learned in the latest announcement of the new head of their board, which has been announced by the BPA. They are among those who have joined the board of The Bath Manufacturers Association (BMA). But  The BBC Newsnight looks at what is going to be the first appointment of an honorary officer to become the Board of Associations for the UK and Ireland - and what could have been the biggest changes to the way the business is under way across England and Wales, as they announce the names of its experts and senior figures from within the sector, and are now being named as managers of goods and services including residential, commercial and commercial bathrooms in England, UK, Ireland and the Republic of Ireland (BA) to join the organisation. Here is the full list of board members known for helping them to improve sustainable services and improve the quality of sanitary products in Scotland and North Wales. The chairman of this board is Lisa Whitfield, who is to serve as its expert board member, in an attempt to tackle climate change and change in its business. But what will be behind the job?
