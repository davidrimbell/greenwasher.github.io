    <p> At a recent TSESG event in New York, a straw poll revealed that only 10% of attendees believed the term  ESG investing  would persist in five years. Some attendees expressed the view that the term is toxic and will vanish in the US, implying significant implications for marketing, branding, and communication efforts. However, evidence suggests a mixed outlook.  Schroders and BlackRock have adopted alternative terminology, with BlackRock focusing on  transition investing.

The presence of ESG in job titles and investment roles, as well as the increasing number of ESG investment job postings, indicate its embeddedness in the asset management industry.  ESG has become intertwined with the asset management business, and it is likely to continue as a neutral source of data and insights for investors and regulators.

However, asset managers must carefully consider market research and long-term strategies to navigate potential shifts in terminology. Millennial and Gen-Z investors, as well as minorities, show strong support for ESG, particularly in the  social  aspect.  November 5 in the US may influence ESG s future, but the climate transition embedded in the IRA suggests a major shift away from sustainable investing is unlikely. Asset managers must adopt an integrated approach, from investment to marketing and sales, to effectively</p>
