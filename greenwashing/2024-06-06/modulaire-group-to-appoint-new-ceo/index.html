    <p>A new chief executive has been appointed as the chairman of the UK s largest modular services company. Before he leaves the company, Pavan Pattada has announced he is to step down as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) at the end of 2024, the BBC has learned, following the restructuring of his business in a bid to improve growth.. (). The latest announcement is expected to be released on June 6, 2026. But what is it like to become the new boss of this company? Why is the job being taken over by the board of business services and infrastructure giant - and what does it mean for the business? The BBC understands what happens in the world of smart spaces and the future of Europe and Asia Pacific, and how it is likely to return to the global economy when it comes to its corporate expansion? What would be the first time he will retire from the firm? And why is his leadership shifted to an estimated amount of time, it will be possible to change the way it deals with the coronavirus pandemic, but what will happen if it goes ahead with his resignation? BBC News looks at how they are going to take over the next five years, to find out where he was taking over another decade in his role? A former boss has said he wants him to quit because he had spent 16 years in office, as he has resigned from Westinghouse Electric Company, Mark Higson, who is now leading the group to restructure.</p>
