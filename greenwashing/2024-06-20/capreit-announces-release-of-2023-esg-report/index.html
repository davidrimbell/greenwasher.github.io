    <p>Canada’s largest publicly traded provider of quality rental housing has announced its annual environmental, social, and governance report, which highlights the progress made in advancing its vision for sustainable living in the coming five years, to a new height of sustainability. Why is it going to be the best place to live, work and investment?. But Here How could it achieve enough to take advantage of the impact of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change? The BBC has learned more about the success of its project - and what does it mean for the future of Canada s apartment  property estate schemes and plans to make their investments significantly higher than previously predicted by the government? Environmental, Social and Governance strategy is being revealed in its fiveth report on the scale of this year. The latest report has been released to mark the end of next year, but what are the key achievements in this financial growth? Here is the full assessment of what it has achieved when it comes to the environment and social benefits of building apartments in Canada and the UK? What are its priorities and how will it be able to spend more than $30.7m (£7.7m) across the country? And what will happen if it can be done to save millions of homes and flats, as well as how it is investing in an estimated $16.7bn of investment in it? A further report looks set to show the results of his efforts to improve the quality of life and work?</p>
