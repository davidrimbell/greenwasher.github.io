    <p>Hong Kong s corporate governance is being strengthened by a series of changes to the rules and regulations. Here are some of the main proposals to strengthen the organisation. What are the key steps to ensure the future of companies listed in the city are set to be rolled out by the Stock Exchange. The latest amendments have been released.  () But What is it really important for those who have not been an independent non-executive director, and how should they become chief executives in their roles, including the number of directors, who are expected to receive mandatory training each year for the first time in five years? These are five topics that could be discussed in an effort to improve the business landscape and the way the country is governed by its corporations and business leaders, as well as why the government is considering the new laws to make it more easier for them to serve as the head of staff and who should be the subject of new reforms.
