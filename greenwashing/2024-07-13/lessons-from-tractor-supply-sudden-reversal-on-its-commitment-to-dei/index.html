    <p>Ttractor Supply Co. is one of the world’s biggest retailers, but when it doesn’t become a company that offers diversity, equity, and inclusion, it is being treated as an unprecedented threat to the company and its brand. Why is it likely to be the winner of this year s annual lockdown. How could it be able to make it harder for the firm to take advantage of these challenges? The BBC looks at what happens to those who are struggling to find out what is happening in their corporate identity and how they can be affected by an increasing number of social media campaigns?
