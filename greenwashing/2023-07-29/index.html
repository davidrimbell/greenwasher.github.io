  <meta name="title" content="&#34;Green Liberty: Celebrating 30 Years of Environmental Activism in Latvia&#34;"/>
  <meta name="description" content="Latvian NGO &ldquo;Green Liberty&rdquo; is celebrating its 30th anniversary as the oldest environmental organization in Latvia. The organization, which describes itself as &ldquo;green anarchists,&rdquo; works from within the system to create a more equitable and sustainable world. Their focus is on decarbonizing the energy system and resources, as climate change is one of the most significant global risks. They emphasize citizen involvement and have created workshops, events, and interactive tools to educate and engage the public in environmental issues. While progress has been made, there is still much work to be done to tackle the climate crisis, poverty, and pollution.
The Home Depot has released its latest ESG report, highlighting its commitment to its three pillars: focusing on people, operating sustainably, and strengthening communities. Some key achievements include over 90% of U.S. store leaders starting as hourly associates, 36% of new hires being women, and a 52% decrease in electricity consumption in U.S. stores since 2010. The Home Depot Foundation has also contributed over $450 million towards veteran causes since 2011 and funded over 184 projects benefiting 70% of HBCUs through its Retool Your School grant program.
BacTech Environmental Corp. has engaged an Ecuador-based securities firm, Analytica Securities, to help market its proposed offering of $20 million in Green Bonds. The funds raised will be used to pay for the construction of BacTech&rsquo;s bioleaching plant in Tenguel. The company aims to access a global pool of sustainable investors interested in financing environmental and social projects. BacTech&rsquo;s bond framework aligns with the International Capital Market Association&rsquo;s Green Bond Principles, and the company has received a sustainability quality score of SQS2 from Moody&rsquo;s. The plant will use naturally occurring bacteria to recover metals from tailings and mines.
The global demand for key metals and minerals needed for renewable energy projects and clean technologies is expected to rise even further than current forecasts suggest, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). The critical minerals market for clean energy reached $320 billion in 2022 and is projected to continue growing. The demand for minerals such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, and copper is expected to rise exponentially in the coming decades. To meet this demand, new mining projects will be required worldwide. The development of the renewable recycling industry could also help recover and reuse these critical minerals.
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) has announced plans to issue the second series of transition bonds to support its energy transition initiatives. The company aims to achieve &ldquo;Net Zero&rdquo; by 2040 and contribute to the realization of a carbon-neutral society. MHI has been selected as a model example for the &ldquo;2021 Climate Transition Finance Model Projects&rdquo; and issued its first transition bonds in 2022. By diversifying its financing methods and promoting energy transition, MHI aims to contribute to a carbon-neutral future. MHI Group is a leading industrial group focused on energy, smart infrastructure, industrial machinery, aerospace, and defense.
Cogo, a carbon impact platform, is partnering with mobile banking apps to inform and change behaviors regarding carbon emissions. The platform calculates the carbon emissions of transactions and aims to help individuals and businesses reduce their impact on the climate. The UK&rsquo;s Behavioural Insights Team, also known as The Nudge Unit, has partnered with Cogo to explore how banks can encourage sustainable behaviors through carbon feedback on transactions. The goal is to transition to a low-carbon economy and incentivize consumers to make environmentally friendly choices. Other companies, such as ecolytiq, are also implementing carbon tracking in banking apps. The article suggests that this push towards carbon reduction may lead to a net zero social credit system.
Pierre Laprée, Chief Product Officer at SpendHQ, discusses his journey into procurement, the challenges facing procurement companies in sustainability, and the role of procurement in driving ESG initiatives. SpendHQ provides enterprise spend intelligence and procurement performance management solutions, helping organizations gain visibility into their spending patterns, generate insights from data, and manage procurement performance. Laprée emphasizes the importance of addressing data challenges and collaborating with stakeholders to achieve ESG goals. He also highlights the role of procurement in promoting responsibility and sustainability throughout the organization and supply chain. SpendHQ facilitates cross-functional teamwork and ESG reporting to support collaboration and progress tracking.
Solid-state batteries offer high energy density and fast charging times, making them attractive for electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers. Development of solid-state batteries is primarily happening in Asia, with companies like Toyota, Nissan, and Samsung actively working on bringing them to the market. Outside of Asia, automakers like Ford, BMW, Volkswagen, and Hyundai have invested in battery startups to develop viable solid-state batteries for their EVs. However, solid-state batteries face challenges such as high costs, limited metal sourcing, temperature sensitivity, and degradation after repeated charging cycles. The future of solid-state batteries in cars is uncertain, but the industry remains hopeful due to their potential advantages.
Vedanta Ltd. has achieved a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across its units since 2021. Its subsidiary, Hindustan Zinc Ltd., aims to achieve a 50% reduction by 2025. The company has signed a large renewable energy contract of 2.5 gigawatts to achieve its net-zero goals before 2050. Vedanta has also created an ESG vertical and has set nine top priority Environmental, Social &amp; Corporate Governance (ESG) goals, including becoming zero carbon by 2050. The company is focused on gender diversity, water positivity, and impacting the lives of 100 million women and children.
These news summaries highlight the ongoing efforts and challenges in the fight against climate change and the promotion of sustainability. From the work of NGOs like &ldquo;Green Liberty&rdquo; to the commitment of companies like The Home Depot and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, there is a growing recognition of the need for a more equitable and sustainable world. However, it is important to remain vigilant and aware of greenwashing and deceptive practices that may undermine these efforts. By staying informed and holding companies accountable, we can work towards a greener future for ourselves and future generations.
