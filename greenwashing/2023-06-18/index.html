  <meta name="description" content="A new study by Elevate, an ESG advisory and analytics company, has revealed concerning findings about the treatment of vulnerable populations, including migrant children, in the US. The study found that the US has joined a list of countries with high ESG supply-chain risks, primarily due to inadequate protections for these populations. This is a significant decline for the US, as it saw a decrease in its ranking on almost all metrics.
One of the most severe forms of ESG risk identified in the study is the treatment of children. Shockingly, companies in the US have been found to employ children as young as 12 in dangerous conditions. This revelation highlights the need for stronger regulations and enforcement to protect vulnerable populations.
The study also highlighted increasing risks and less transparency in regions that are normally considered safe. This is a concerning trend, as it indicates that even in countries with established regulations, there are still risks of exploitation and mistreatment.
In another news, Toyota Motor Corporation Chairman Akio Toyoda has been re-elected to the board of the company, despite pressure from activist investors to oust him. These investors were pushing for a rapid shift to electric vehicles (EVs), while Toyoda favored a multi-option approach that included hybrids, hydrogen, and gas options.
Toyota has raised valid concerns about the viability of a wholesale shift to EVs. They have highlighted potential challenges such as the impact on the supply chain, job losses, lithium supplies, infrastructure, and power grids. It is important to consider these factors when discussing the transition to a more sustainable transportation system.
However, under the new president, Koji Sato, Toyota plans to introduce 10 EV models by 2026, showing a commitment to embracing electric vehicles while maintaining a mix of vehicle options. This approach acknowledges the complexity of the transition and the need for a balanced strategy.
In the realm of waste reduction, Chipotle is taking steps to increase its composting efforts across its restaurants. The company aims to divert 49% of its overall waste from landfills by 2022. Chipotle plans to expand its composting programs to at least 23% more restaurants in 2023.
Chipotle is also linking executive compensation to environmental goals, including waste reduction. This shows a commitment to sustainability at the highest level of the company. However, there are challenges to composting, such as finding compostable alternatives for certain products and dealing with varying local regulations. Chipotle believes that educating consumers and increasing composting infrastructure will help drive change.
In India, the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce &amp; Industry (FICCI) is partnering with Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) to establish a &lsquo;Centre for Sustainability Leadership&rsquo;. The aim is to support India Inc in achieving its climate goals and promote sustainability leadership among FICCI members.
The Centre will focus on decarbonisation, green entrepreneurship, and nature-based solutions. It will provide training programs, workshops, and bespoke solutions for climate action, as well as showcase innovations by sustainability start-ups. This initiative is a positive step towards fostering sustainability leadership and driving change in India.
In Vietnam, the green loan market is still relatively small, with green loans accounting for only 4.2% of total outstanding loans. Efforts are being made to develop policies and systems to facilitate the creation and deployment of green and sustainable financial products. However, concerns about &ldquo;greenwashing&rdquo; and a lack of comprehensive policies and frameworks are hindering the mobilization of green capital.
Finally, the EY Supply Chain Sustainability 2022 Report highlights the increasing focus on sustainable operations among supply chain leaders. Eight in 10 supply chain leaders are working towards decarbonization, ethical sourcing, and fair trade. However, challenges such as the lack of transparency and a business case for sustainable supply chains remain.
It is crucial for executives to prioritize sustainability initiatives and tailor them to their business strategies. End-to-end supply chain transformation is necessary to achieve cost reduction, revenue growth, supply chain risk management, and intangible benefits.
These news summaries highlight the importance of transparency, accountability, and responsible business practices in achieving sustainability goals. It is essential for companies and individuals to be aware of the risks of greenwashing and ensure that their actions align with their stated commitments to sustainability. By staying informed and holding companies accountable, we can work towards a greener and more sustainable future for generations to come.
