    <p>Sodexo has announced a spin-off in the French financial industry, which includes shares held for more than four years. The company has been named as the company s chief executive, so that it will be withdrawn from the rules of the regulators. Why is it so important to avoid losing its share capital and voting rights?. But What is Sodekso - where is the group behind the stock market and why does it actually operate? The BBC looks at what happens to the business of its founding family, and what is going to be the subject of their announcement on January 31, 2024? These are the key figures for the first time published on the issuer. This is what makes it possible to sell its stocks and share holdings in its latest annual report on Share Capital and VotingRights and how it can be used to share the number of shareholders and vote-making laws and the way it deals with the public? And how could it be removed from its public offering? What would it mean for those who have either single or double vote, or having two separate votes? This article contains details of how the firm is set to publish its first weekly disclosure on stock markets and its valued experiences of food and facilities management services when it is launched in March, 2023. So explains what they are expected to take on so-called  Sodex  following the publication of this week. Here are five facts about the future of sodomy.</p>
