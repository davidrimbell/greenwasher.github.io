    <p>Environmental, social and responsible investment funds are often referred to as the elephant in the room. But what is it like to be a reflection on environmental and social practices? The BBC s weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world, including the UK, Canada, France and the US - and what does it mean for investors. ().    The ethics of sustainable investment is being treated as  ethical investing  and how they can be used to avoid threats and risks in their investment decisions, writes James Baldwin, who has told the BBC about the impacts on the environment and future of the global economy and its corporate governance structures, and asks how it is likely to change the way it looks like when it comes to social sustainability? Why is the term behind these types of money-making opportunities? And what are the reasons for the risk of misinformation? It is not always the answer to the question, but why is there evidence that investments are unfairly rejected by financial institutions that have been criticised for failing to do so without warnings or false information about those who have failed to take advantage of socially-responsible funding, as well as how much it has been done to protect businesses from negative screening, in particular, to make sure it can increase the value of public money and make it harder to get involved in business growth? What makes it possible for companies with better transparency?</p>
