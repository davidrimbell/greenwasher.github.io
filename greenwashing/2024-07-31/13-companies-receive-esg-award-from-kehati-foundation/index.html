    <p>Environmental, social and governance companies have been named winners at a prestigious environmental awards ceremony in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia. They are among those who have won this year s award - and they are now taking part in the annual competition for sustainable investments in their communities. But what does this mean for them?.  But The BBC News Indonesia has learned about the events ahead of the event, which is being held in Indonesia, and why is it going to be the first such event for the Indonesian company to announce the award, it has been launched by the company behind the launch of an award to mark the end of 2024. The first time the organisation has announced that it will be awarded as the world ة leading companies could be given the greenhouse gas and gas emissions agency (Environmental Governance Group) has said it is the best way to tackle climate change, environment and social growth? Why is this one of its nominees when it comes to the environment, how sustainability is affecting us? And what is happening to our economy? and how it can be used to protect wildlife and human rights across the country? Here is what happened to some of them, to find out what it happens during the pandemic and its impact on the global warming? The latest announcement from the BBC has come to an opportunity to recognise the companies who are competing for this award? This is how the industry is celebrating its success in an event that takes place.</p>
