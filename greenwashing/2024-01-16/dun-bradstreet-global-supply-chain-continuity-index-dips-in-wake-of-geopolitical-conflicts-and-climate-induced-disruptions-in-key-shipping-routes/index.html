    <p>Global businesses are increasingly concerned about their ability to cope with geopolitical and policy shocks, according to a report released by Dun &amp; Bradstreet International, the world s biggest business advisory firm, Dun and Brad Street International (DNB), which published its annual report on the global supply chain continued to fall sharply in 2024. But  The economy is now  optimistic  towards growth opportunities and risks in the coming few years, but experts say they are now looking at higher tolerance for risk and further adaptability, as it reveals the impacts of climate-related disruptions and trade disputes, and is focusing more on rising supplies and delayed delivery times, despite efforts to tackle threats related to the coronavirus pandemic, trade war and economic crises that have caused severe decline in global trade and food markets, with the loss of more than 6.6% in Q1 2028, it has been reported by one of the UKs most leading business figures for the first time in nearly two decades - and it is likely to be expected to see another increase in business optimism among those affected by geopolitics and conflicts over the past two years. Why is this shift in mindset and the risk is being considered as the focus of global business leaders in recent weeks and will remain cautious of geopoltica and international tensions and other challenges during the next decade? These are the key findings.</p>
