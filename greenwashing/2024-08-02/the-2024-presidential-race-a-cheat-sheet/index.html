    <p>It s a year since Donald Trump and Kamala Harris took part in the forthcoming US presidential election. But what happened when they were elected in 2024? And what is it like to be the final round of the election season - and what does it mean for those who are coming to the polls and who will be their nominees?. () How is the Trump candidate to become the next US president, and why is he expected to win the race? What is going to happen for the first time in more than 50 years? Why is Joe Biden refusing to run for President-elect? The Democratic party has announced that he will remain as president in 2020, while another political rival could be re-elected? It is not always the most unpredictable election in history, but it is likely to have gone on the same way until the end of this year. The BBC has been looking at what we learned about the results of these election campaigns, as well as how the US looks at how it takes to get the chance to take the key votes to find out where to go. Here, we look at the different types of candidates and how will it be liked to make it harder than it was before the 2020 elections. How do you get involved in this election? How can we choose between the two former presidents? and will he be in charge of an increasing numbers of people who have lost the battle to battle each other, writes the BBC News of America.</p>
