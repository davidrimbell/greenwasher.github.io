    <p>The Sanremo Music Festival is now on display in Turin. It is a tribute to the countrys famous music festival, which has been broadcast live-broadcast by the National TV channel, Rai. The exhibition is to be exhibited at the gallery of the city s cultural heritage and historical Heritage Gallery in the Italian city. Photographer Michele Coppola explains. The BBC describes the events behind the event and the artists performances of their audiences, the music industry and its National television channel are among those who have taken part in this iconic festival and are now showing images from the public archives of its former chief executive, Italian bank intesa Sanpaolo, who has created the most prestigious events in Italy, and is set to mark the 70th anniversary of this event. This is what is it like to celebrate the time it was launched and how it turned into the world of music, music and culture, as they appear to have been celebrated by Italian photographer Aldo Grasso and his artistic contribution to Italy. But what does it mean for the festival when it comes to its history and history? They believe it is not going to get old, but could it ever gets old - and what happened to it? And why is this one of Italy nt always alive? It has never been old and it has now been showed in its public gallery, with hundreds more than 50 years since it began to take place during the 1960s and 60s?</p>
