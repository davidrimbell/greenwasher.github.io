    <p>A Nigerian bank has been recognised as the best corporate bank in the world, according to the Euromoney Awards for Excellence (Excellence Awards) in 2023, Nigerias financial inclusion services provider. These awards have been announced in a ceremony in Abuja, the capital of Nigeria, on Sunday. The BBC s Africa Eye looks at the achievements. But  (The BBC News Arabic reports from Ghana and Nigeria) explains what it says is going to be the biggest annual award of the year. Here is the full list of winners and nominees for this award. This year, we speak to those who trust us for trusting them and helping their customers achieve success through innovative banking technology. It has become the first foreign bank to win the award for excellence in Nigeria which has won the most prestigious award in Europe and Africa, but they are among the banks who have gone on the top prize in this year - and it is now being awarded the Best Corporate Bank in its history, and how it has achieved its successful growth in technology, technology and technology across the country, as well as how the bank makes its business shifts towards the global economy. But what does it do to help its customers get the same quality of service when it launches its new strategy, how to respond to its demands of customers and the way it deals with businesses and services based on technology in international markets and other industries. What is it like to get behind these awards?</p>
