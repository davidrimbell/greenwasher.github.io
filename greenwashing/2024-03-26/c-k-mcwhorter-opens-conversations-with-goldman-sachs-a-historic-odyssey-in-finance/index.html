    <p>US businessman C.K. McWhorter has opened talks with a leading global investment bank, Goldman Sachs, to launch an ambitious journey towards potential leveraged buyouts (LBOs) in the realm of luxury assets. The BBC s weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world, from the globe and beyond. Why does this describe their strategy? They explain why they want to be able to become the first investors in developing wealthy businesses to develop innovative technology, sustainable practices and social governance initiatives in finance and investment, and what is the role of the business endeavours of minority-led ventures. Here are the key takeaways from his latest announcement. A Historic Odyssey in Finance. This week, we speak to the director general of US Financial Advisory Committee (CBI) - and how it is being referred to as an iconic discovery of his vision, vision and vision for the future of business. What is it like to take advantage of its corporate identity and the impact of social responsibility and economic growth? This is what it means for him to start negotiations with the company. It is an important step in his approach to fundraising and investing across the UK and Canada. But what makes it possible for his success? The Treasury has been told by the BBC, but what will it mean for those who are taking part in this business? Here, the story of Carter Mc W Horter. How is he going to achieve this?</p>
