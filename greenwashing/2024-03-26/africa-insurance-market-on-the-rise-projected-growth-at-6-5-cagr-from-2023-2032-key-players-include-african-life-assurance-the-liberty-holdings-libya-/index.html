    <p>Africa s insurance market is expected to reach US$153.9billion by 2028, a new report has revealed. These are the key factors behind the growing number of working-age individuals and small businesses entering the workforce and becoming financially independent. The latest report says the market could increase by 6.5% during 2024. But How is Africa going to grow and how is it likely to be worth more than $200bn (27m) in the next two decades, and why is the country increasingly developing insurance products? The BBC looks at the impact of the rise in insurance growth in Africa, as the industry tries to boost its economy and boost the economic development of society and its impact on the global insurance industry, but what does it mean for the continent?

And how will it become the biggest market for life, health and other types of insurance? What are these trends and what will contribute to the Africa Insurance Market? A report from research and market research has been released. Here is what the BBC has learned about the future of this market. A summary of what is in common for those who believe they will be the most successful examples of how the UK is prepared to launch changes to its future? How would it be like to develop another global market?</p>
