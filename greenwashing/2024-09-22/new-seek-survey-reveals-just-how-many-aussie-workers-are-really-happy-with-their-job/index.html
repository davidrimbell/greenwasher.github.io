    <p> The SEEK Happiness Index Survey revealed that nearly half of Australian workers are unhappy at work, with purpose being the top factor contributing to workplace happiness. Despite location being a source of happiness for 68% of respondents, it was not considered a significant factor in overall job satisfaction. Salary and stress levels were also not deemed as crucial for happiness compared to factors like senior management and day-to-day activities.  The survey, which included over 1200 workers from various generations, industries, and income levels, found that South Australian workers were the happiest (67%), while Western Australians were the least happy (46%). Government workers (71%) and retail and consumer products workers (63%) reported higher happiness levels, while only 25% of engineering and 40% of construction workers felt happy at work.  Gen Z workers were the least happy demographic, with only 50% reporting happiness at work. They expressed dissatisfaction with career progression opportunities, senior leadership, and the company s ESG commitment. In contrast, Baby Boomers were the most content at work (61%).  Transitioning Well co-director Justine Alter emphasized the importance of workplace happiness, noting its positive impact on mental health and productivity. Unhappy workers are more likely to consider changing jobs, highlighting the value of happiness for Australian businesses and the labor market.  Overall, the survey suggests that while many Australian workers are struggling with financial uncertainty and changing work dynamics, finding purpose and satisfaction in their roles is crucial for overall wellbeing and productivity.</p>
