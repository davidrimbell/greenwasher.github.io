  <meta name="title" content="Coconino County Treasurer Testifies Against Anti-ESG Legislation, Citing Harm to Local Economies"/>
  <meta name="description" content="Coconino County Treasurer Sarah Benatar recently testified before House lawmakers, expressing her concerns about &ldquo;anti-ESG&rdquo; legislation that limits the consideration of environmental, social, and governance factors in financial decision-making. Benatar argued that these laws prevent financial officials from considering climate risk as a financial risk factor and reduce service banking competition, which harms local economies. However, GOP lawmakers disagreed, stating that allowing ESG and climate-risk factors in financial decision-making politicizes economic decisions. This hearing comes as more states pass anti-ESG legislation, protecting the fossil fuel industry and states reliant on it. Benatar warned that these laws could increase costs and reduce options for counties.
In the world of sports, the UEFA EURO 2024 ESG strategy has been published, with the aim of making the tournament the most sustainable European Championship ever. The strategy focuses on reducing environmental impact, investing in a climate fund, fighting discrimination, promoting physical activity and healthy food options, fostering ties with grassroots football, adopting responsible conduct, sharing knowledge and good practices, and cooperating with stakeholders to create a sustainable legacy. This strategy aligns with the United Nations&#39; Sustainable Development Goals and reflects increased societal expectations around sustainability in football. The German Football Association and the German government are fully committed to the sustainability goals of EURO 2024.
Telecommunications solutions provider Ekinops has secured a new credit line of €100 million ($118 million) to support its development and external growth strategy. The financing, provided by a banking pool including Caisse Régionale de Crédit Agricole Mutuel des Cotes d&rsquo;Armor, Banque Populaire Grand Ouest, BNP Paribas, and KBC Bank, consists of a €50 million loan facility for M&amp;A transactions and a €10 million revolving credit facility. The company&rsquo;s strong financial position and commitment to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria were key factors in securing the financing.
However, not all news is positive when it comes to ESG. The House Financial Services Committee recently held a hearing criticizing ESG regulations and shareholder activism. The focus was on the proxy process and the role of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in facilitating politically motivated shareholder proposals. The hearing also criticized the federal government&rsquo;s climate reporting requirements, including the SEC&rsquo;s proposed 500-page climate disclosure rule. These activities indicate potential policy initiatives under a Republican administration and highlight legal strategies that could be used to attack ESG policies and regulations. The proxy process was identified as an area that requires greater transparency and accountability. The current focus on ESG detracts from the primary purpose of public markets, which is to enable companies to raise capital and foster economic growth.
In the financial world, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander criticized BlackRock&rsquo;s decision to appoint the CEO of Saudi Aramco to its board, stating that it goes against BlackRock&rsquo;s commitment to addressing climate risk. BlackRock, the largest external money manager for New York City, has faced criticism from both Republicans and environmentalists regarding its stance on climate change and support for the fossil fuel industry. Lander previously accused BlackRock of backtracking on climate pledges. The appointment of the CEO of Aramco, a company widely blacklisted among ESG funds, has raised concerns about BlackRock&rsquo;s ability to engage with portfolio companies on climate issues.
Moving to the transportation sector, five months ago, a train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio caused significant health issues for residents. Norfolk Southern, the company responsible, has been criticized for its lack of assistance and prioritizing leftist ideologies over the well-being of the community. The company has focused on promoting environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. Meanwhile, the people of East Palestine continue to suffer from illnesses, and their trust in Norfolk Southern and the government has diminished. Legislation has been introduced to improve rail safety regulations, but rail companies, including Norfolk Southern, oppose it. A health study is being conducted to assess the impact of chemical exposure on the community.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has faced criticism for delaying regulations on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investment products. The regulations, which would require firms to provide more details on products marketed as green and eco-friendly, were due to be published in the third quarter of this year but will now be delayed until the final three months of the year. The delay has been described as &ldquo;deeply disappointing&rdquo; by a top sustainability group, who called for urgent progress on other green finance policies. The FCA has stated that it is important to get the rules right to protect consumers.
In the United States, the Biden administration has been criticized for not enacting enough policies to limit drilling permits or manage a decline in oil and gas production. A proposed rule by the US Bureau of Land Management (BLM) aims to prioritize the health and resilience of ecosystems on public lands by protecting intact landscapes and making management decisions based on science and data. However, opponents argue that the rule excludes mining, energy development, and agriculture. The rule also proposes to codify procedures for identifying and evaluating rangelands for environmental concern. Critics argue that major improvements are needed to address the climate crisis on public lands.
The Commissioner of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has highlighted the importance of understanding and managing climate risk in commodities markets. Severe climate events have already caused significant losses for farmers and ranchers, and the impacts are expected to worsen. The Commissioner emphasized the role of derivatives markets in managing risk and promoting climate resilience. However, voluntary carbon credit markets face challenges such as fragmentation and a lack of transparency, which undermine market confidence. The Commissioner proposed working with exchanges to establish listing standards for environmental products and adopting a heightened review framework for self-certified environmental products. The CFTC also has antifraud authority over spot markets and recently launched an Environmental Fraud Task Force to combat fraud in voluntary carbon markets.
In the corporate world, AIA Insurance has received the ISO 14064-1:2018 Greenhouse Gas Emissions certification, recognizing its commitment to sustainability and efforts to reduce its carbon footprint. The certification is awarded to companies that demonstrate their ability to measure and reduce greenhouse gas emissions across the entire organization. AIA Insurance has implemented initiatives such as paperless services, energy-efficient lighting, and the use of renewable energy sources to reduce emissions. The company aims to continue implementing sustainable practices to create a healthier and greener future.
Lastly, Toad&amp;Co, an outdoor lifestyle brand, is committed to sustainability in the apparel industry. They use at least 80% sustainable fibers and fabrics in their clothing, such as hemp, organic cotton, TENCEL Lyocell, and recycled fibers. They also prioritize shipping sustainability by offering reusable shippers and working towards eliminating plastic-based product packaging. Toad&amp;Co stands behind their products with a Joy-Backed Guarantee, ensuring that customers feel good and are satisfied with their purchases. Overall, Toad&amp;Co is dedicated to creating high-quality, sustainable clothing that people will love to wear.
These news summaries highlight the ongoing discussions and actions surrounding greenwashing, ESG, and sustainability. It is important for consumers to stay informed and hold companies accountable for their environmental and social commitments. By supporting brands and organizations that prioritize sustainability, individuals can contribute to a greener and more sustainable future for generations to come.
