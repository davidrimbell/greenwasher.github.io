  <meta name="description" content="World leaders are meeting at COP28, a UN summit, to address the urgent environmental crisis. The US Inflation Reduction Act has created green jobs and clean energy projects, showing progress in the fight against climate change. But conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East could hinder global climate action by promoting reliance on oil and causing division among world leaders.
To address misleading environmental claims, the European Union has made new rules to fight greenwashing and has put a tax on imported carbon. These rules aim to make companies responsible for their dishonest practices and limit the import of products connected to deforestation. Greenpeace Canada and Indonesian group Auriga Nusantara have complained to the Forest Stewardship Council, asking for sustainability certificates to be taken away from Paper Excellence, Canada&rsquo;s biggest forestry company. If the complaint succeeds, it could have a big impact on the company&rsquo;s finances.
In the business world, global consulting firm BIP has bought sustainability consultancy Verco, with the goal of offering a more complete and effective service in addressing climate change. This purchase will make Verco&rsquo;s services stronger and help them work towards a world with no carbon emissions. But some people say that asset managers&#39; focus on the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) agenda is hurting Americans&#39; retirement savings. The debate about ESG investing continues, with critics saying it lowers profits and puts retirement savings at risk, while supporters argue that it helps economic freedom.
Markel&rsquo;s insurance division has promised to reduce its impact on the environment and follow ESG requirements. But there are still companies in the US that don&rsquo;t have the same philosophy. On the other hand, AAR Corp, a top provider of aviation services, has released a report showing its commitment to environmental sustainability, social responsibility, and ethical governance.
Lastly, Indonesia&rsquo;s new carbon exchange could make carbon credit certification a profitable business as companies try to show they are sustainable. But experts say that the rules for this are not finished yet, and there need to be improvements to properly measure the carbon footprint of logging areas.
As world leaders meet at COP28, it is clear that fighting greenwashing and supporting real sustainability efforts are important. We don&rsquo;t know yet how these measures will affect the goals of COP27, but things might change because of upcoming elections and economic problems. It is important for consumers to stay informed and make companies responsible for their actions so that future generations have a better world.
