    <p>A US retailer has announced it will withdraw from its carbon emissions targets, including environmental, social and governance (DEI) goals. But what is it likely to be the biggest shift in corporate diversity and inclusion efforts in the US? The BBC s weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world and the globe.. () What is this announcement - and how is the company changing its approach to climate change and human rights campaigns, and what does it mean for a growing number of businesses across the United States which have been threatened by legal attacks against their actions? Why is there an increasing row over the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and its sustainability policies? And why has it taken another step towards making changes to its policy and message of how it approaches its own strategy? What has happened to the firm? A few weeks after it said it was going to take steps to tackle claims that it is being rejected by conservative backlash and litigation, but it has been described as the  stunning move  to stop it from taking advantage of legal action in recent months. When it comes to carbon and water conservation, the BBC has learned that they have changed the way it deals with the environment and environment initiatives in US industries. The latest move has come to an end to one of its major challenges ahead of this week, as it decided to remove all of it.</p>
