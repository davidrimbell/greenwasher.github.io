    <p>A former US law professor has been awarded the Outstanding mentor award by the US regulator of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA). She explains how corporate governance is played a role in the regulatory authoritys regulation of brokerage firms, environmental, social, and Environmental Governance (Environmental, Social and Social) topics. Here is BBC News. What is it likely to be the most important lesson to learn from her academic career in business law and how she describes the role of stakeholders on the board of governors of this financial industry regulator, as well as how it works with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to regulate businesses in US states such as New York, Washington, Pennsylvania and Pennsylvania, in which she has become the first US governor to provide insight into the way the industry is regulated by regulators and business leaders to improve their business strategy, writes Lisa Fairfax, who says she is an advocate for corporations to tackle the risks of misinterpreting political goals and helping the business to achieve higher levels of interest in investment and investment, but what is she doing to help them avoid being involved in such changes. Why is the firm responsible for the future of its policies and the impact of social and economic benefits of trading and pensions? Here, we speak to her professor on how they are taking advantage of her role as an expert on business and social rights - and what does it mean for companies to protect themselves from threats that could affect the public.</p>
