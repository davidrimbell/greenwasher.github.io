    <p>The chief executive of BlackRock, Steve Fink, has announced a $1.5m (1.4m) increase in security costs for his company and its shareholders in 2023, according to his annual chairmans letter to investors, the Financial Times has learned in the New York Times and the US state news agency NBC News reports..  But  The US company says it has paid $2.9m in spending on security for him and his predecessor, Bob Iger, is among those responsible for their financial fortunes, as it spent $2.5m on the security services for the company in 2022, in an attempt to stop fossil fuel activists taking part in global climate change campaigns and renewable energy initiatives. The company has said it will pay $1.3m worth of damage to the business. Before he becomes the first person to receive compensation from the firm, it is now expected to spend $1.2m to protect his personal security service for its Chief Executive, Robert Kapito, who has been named as the head of the private estate giant, to pay more than $1bn ($7m; $2.1m), which includes $1.9m of its security schemes to help him secure the future of his business - including savings of US firms that are being saved by environmental causes in his year-long effort to tackle the impact of greenhouse gas emissions strikes on his own corporate accounts. Here is the full list of details.</p>
