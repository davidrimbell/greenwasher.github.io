    <p> Javier Milei, Argentina s self-proclaimed  anarcho-capitalist  president, has taken a strong stance against the United Nations   Pact for the Future  and the broader sustainability agenda, which he views as a threat to individual freedoms and national sovereignty. Milei criticized the U.N. for its perceived shift from defending human rights to systematically violating them, particularly through its support of global quarantines during the COVID-19 pandemic and its appeasement of dictatorships.  Milei argued that the U.N. has transformed into a  multi-tentacled leviathan  that seeks to impose an ideology on its members, rather than promoting peace. He also expressed concern that the U.N. s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which includes 17 interlinked global goals, is part of a broader anti-capitalist campaign that aims to create a totalitarian system of conformity across the business sector.  Milei and Paul Tice, an adjunct professor of finance, both view the sustainability agenda as a super-national socialist government program that undermines the sovereignty of nation-states and violates individual rights. They argue that the agenda is a permanent supranational bureaucracy that insulates itself from accountability and seeks to solve modern problems with solutions that deepen existing issues.  Milei has called for other nations to join him in opposing the  Pact of the Future  and in creating a new agenda focused on freedom. He warned that the pact, which overlaps with the sustainability agenda, is a poorly conceived utopian program that will not withstand the incompatible nature and choices of humans.  In summary, Javier Milei has taken a strong stance against the United Nations   Pact for the Future  and the broader sustainability agenda, viewing them as threats to individual freedoms and national sovereignty. He has called for a new agenda focused on freedom and has criticized the U.N. for its perceived shift from defending human rights to system</p>
