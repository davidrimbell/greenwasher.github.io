    <p> The Italian parliament elected four new directors for the state broadcaster Rai, with two from the government s Brothers of Italy (FdI) party and two from the opposition. Federica Frangi, close to FdI, and Roberto Natale, associated with the leftist Green-Left Alliance (AVS), were chosen. However, the opposition was divided, with the Democratic Party (PD) and centrist parties Azione and Italia Viva boycotting Natale s election.  The M5S and AVS played a crucial role in preventing a board without opposition representation, ensuring a balance for pluralism and respecting various sensibilities. The new directors are Alessandro Di Majo (M5S), Antonio Marano (League), Federica Frangi (FdI), and Roberto Natale (AVS).  Meloni, the Premier, aims to rebalance Rai after past left-leaning bias, amidst claims of her appointing like-minded individuals and driving out left-leaning journalists. Rai staff have protested against this move. Meloni refutes claims of turning Rai into a government mouthpiece, stating that the left is upset about Rai no longer being  PD TV.   The bios of the new directors are as follows:  Alessandro Di Majo: Born in Rome on October 20, 1968, he has a law degree and works as a lawyer. He has held positions at the Supreme Court of Cassation and the Italian Olympic Committee (CONI). He has published numerous articles and monographs and is a member of the Presidency Council and General Council of Confindustria Radio Televisioni.  Federica Frangi: Born in Rome on May 8, 1973, she has been a professional journalist since 2005. She has experience in press offices and television broadcasters, and has been involved in trade union activities.  Antonio Marano: Born in Ascoli Satriano in 1956, he is a freelance journalist and television manager. He has held various positions in Rai and has been President of Rai Pubblicità since March 2016.
