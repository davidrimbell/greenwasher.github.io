    <p>Ashland Inc. has reported a drop in sales in the first quarter of the year, driven by lower production volumes and higher revenue. The latest financial results show the company s outlook for the second quarter and full-year fiscal year 2024, and its annual forecasts for next year and the forthcoming third phase of growth.. But  The US company has said it is expected to increase sales and profits from operating activities of $66 million (61 million) during the three months to the end of 2020, as sales continued to decline across the US and US markets, with sales falling sharply in January and December. Average earnings have fallen to $70 million, but income from continuing operations remained weaker than previously predicted by the previous quarter, despite rising demand and declining production levels, sales fell by more than 2% in two months, after sales were slower than they were previous expectations, the BBC has learned. Here is the full assessment of its business performance ahead of this year. This is what analysts see as the firm looks to improve its performance in its second and final quarters as it announces its first and last quarter estimates of sales for another quarter in 2021 and will be based on their ability to cope with the declines of production and sales. A quarterly results have shown significant improvements to its profitability and costs. Asland says it has seen sales declined in three separate areas of business.</p>
