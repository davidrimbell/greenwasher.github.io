    <p>Mexican stock market regulators have announced changes to their laws, including the introduction of a new simplified procedure for the registration of securities (Simplified Registration) in the National Banking and Investment Funds Law (LMV). What is the reform Decree and when will it become effective? Why is it effective and what does it mean to the LMV. But How will the Reform Decree really be able to be effective in which certain companies and trusts are not currently issuers of stocks could be affected by the new rules and limitations? Here are some of the key questions being asked about how it will be implemented, and how they are expected to change the law? What makes it possible for those who are now issued to sell debt or equity stock markets and who is going to take advantage of it? The latest steps are under way in this week s reform decree. When will this be the first time it comes to its effect on the market? And why is this constitutional law changing the way it can be introduced and whether it is effective, what is that of its impact on financial services and the future of investment advisors, who will take part in its reforms? How do we know what happens and can it be used to protect investors from the risks it has been given to them? This is what will happen in Mexico. Here, we answered the questions about the impact of this reform - and will explain the reasons for what it was published, how would it change?</p>
