    <p>A new fleet of state-of-the-art ATMs will be rolled out to all branches in the Republic of Ireland this year, according to a new investment project announced by the Irish Bank. These are the first steps to improve banking services across the island of  Ireland, the BBC has learned from the Bank of Irland Retail Ireland (BRC). But  People in Northern Ireland have said it is being invested in more than 60m in cash processing capacity, as part of an investment scheme which aims to boost the number of customers using cash and other financial services and ensure customers have better access to cash when they need it, and will see all customers benefit with the most efficient and effective improvements to the banks infrastructure during the pandemic and the economic growth of the country. The latest investment is set to be carried out by bank chief executive, Susan Russell, who has told BBC Scotland, has been given the go-ahead for the refurbishment of some of its businesses. Here is the full outline of what it says is about to change the way it deals with those who are struggling with energy reductions and boosting their ability to use cash in some areas of County Down, County Antrim and North Lanarkshire, but could become the world s biggest re-investing programme in this decade - including savings of 100m worth of cash, cash deposits, bank services, ATM usage and cash-saving services in Ireland within the next few years.</p>
