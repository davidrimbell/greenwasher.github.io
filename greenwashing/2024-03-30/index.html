  <meta name="description" content="Greenwashing is when companies lie to make people think they are helping the environment. They do this in industries like oil, finance, and mining.
One way companies do this is by lying in ads about how good their products are for the environment. They might also use tricky words or numbers to pretend they are sustainable when they are not really changing much.
For example, some oil companies have been caught breaking rules and pretending to be better than they are. This shows that they are not honest about being green.
In finance, some companies are saying they care about the environment but are actually not doing much. When they stop investing in eco-friendly funds or raise their profits, it makes people wonder if they really care.
Consumers need to be careful not to fall for greenwashing tricks. By knowing how companies lie to look good, people can make smart choices and make businesses do the right thing.
When companies lie about being green, they lose trust and hurt their reputation. This can lead to money problems, legal trouble, and harm to the environment if they only care about making money.
To fight greenwashing, people need to be aware, hold companies responsible, and ask for honesty. This will help create a better future where businesses care about the environment and society.
