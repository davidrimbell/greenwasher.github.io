    <p>Gold is one of the world s most valuable commodities, but it is also a significant contributor to climate-related threats, according to the latest figures from the US Treasury. Why is it important to be listed as an Asset to Protect and enhance wealth, asks Christine Blasey, who is leading the BBC . () How does gold help protect investors and investers in the future of their portfolios and how it can be used to protect and protect its value over the long-term returns of investor exposure to economic uncertainty? The BBC looks at the impact of gold on the global economy and its impact on environmental, social and governance (FGS) in developing investment strategy? What is the key benefits to gold? These are three key factors that make it an important part of its ability to provide stability and prosperity in future financial growth? Here are five key things we learned about when it comes to stocks or bonds, as well as why it has always been considered worth higher than any other currency, and what makes it really important for those who believe they are increasingly aware of it? And how can it help increase the value of some of them, writes Richard Branson. Here, we explains how the price of Gold has been revealed by analysts in recent years, for the first time, to find out what is happening in our markets and whether it should be seen as the most important evidence.</p>
