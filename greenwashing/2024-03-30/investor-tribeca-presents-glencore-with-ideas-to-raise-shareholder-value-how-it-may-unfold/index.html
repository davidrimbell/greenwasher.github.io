    <p>The Financial Times has reported that the Australian stock market value of Glencore plunged to $53bn (43b). Here is the business of the company, which is owned by a group of Swiss-based mining firms. The BBC s weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world.

This week, we look at the full transcript of what happens to the firm, as the BBC looks at how it is likely to be able to sell its shareholders and share holders. What are the companies behind these announcements? Why is this hugely important business? The company is about to take control of it?
