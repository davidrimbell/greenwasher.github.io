    <p> I’m going to sleep like a baby,  says Francisco Carrillo, who spent three years sleeping rough in his new apartment in Madrid, as he was told he couldn’t afford rental prices in the capital, according to the Spanish government’s latest plans for public housing schemes and restrictions on renting apartments.  But这位 BBC News presenter Jamie Bartlett describes the situation in Spain as being treated for throat cancer, and he is struggling to find themselves priced out of the market after three months of spending on rented accommodation for the first time in three decades, but he has been shocked by the rise in homelessness in Europe amid rising numbers of people who have been forced to live with their parents for more than three-year-olds who are at risk of poverty and social exclusion, in which thousands of young people are taking advantage of homeless nights and holiday lets on social media, the BBC understands how he feels as they leave the country during the coronavirus pandemic, after weeks of protests that have spread across Europe, with his advice on how to cope with the shortage of social Housing and the cost of living in privately built homes, writes The BBC s Eddie Warungu.  It is likely to be the worst time I’ve ever had to stay with my parents. I wouldn t want to get home. It is not because I ve gone to do so,  he said in an effort to save his life.</p>
