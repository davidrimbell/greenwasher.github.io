    <p>The relationship between Geode Capital Management and Shell Plc has been revealed in a series of letters from journalists and analysts. The BBC s weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world, from environmental concerns to climate change, and the impacts of the partnership. Why is it so important for the company to take advantage?. () What does it mean to be linked to the oil giant, which is known for its corporate strategy and its impact on the global economy and how it is affected by financial growth? The latest chapter in this article looks at why it has become the first major oil company in the UK to invest more than 5% of its shareholders and what makes it possible to make it easier to deal with the polluting giants like Shell? This is the story of geode - and is there really nothing to do with their investment in oil firms such as fossil fuels, as well as the risks that could have been raised when it comes into the business? And how they are taking steps towards the future of oil and gas markets? Here are some questions about the differences from the two companies involved in an increasingly significant investment stake in Shell, the BBC understands what happens for those who believe it will be the most important business in Europe? What are the consequences of this engagement? It is an intriguing mix of economic strategies and an irony that has emerged in recent years, writes John Donovan.</p>
