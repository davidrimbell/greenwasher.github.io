    <p>The relationship between Norway s oil giant Shell and the world’s second biggest oil firm has revealed a fascinating relationship, writes Norwegian business editor John Donovan. Why is it so important to avoid the threats of environmental crisis and why is the NBIM responsible for taking advantage of the oil company while it is growing,. How is N BIM really involved in this relationship and how does it actually affect the business of oil producers and its investors in the UK and Europe? The BBC has been looking at how the relationship is affected by the company and what has happened over the past two decades, with the impact of its investment in Shell Plc? What makes it harder to find out when it comes to power, influence and hypocrisy? And how can it be linked to Shell? Should it make it more important for the future of future generations of people to see their fortunes? How can they become increasingly significantly more wealthy than those who have spent more than three years - and is there an impact on the industry? Here, we look at what is happening to the two companies behind each other, as the BBC looks at the way it deals with oil and gas firms, and whether it can be seen as an opportunity to achieve sustainable growth in renewed power and increased sustainability? This is what could be the answer to this question, but what do you think about the role it has ever played out in recent years? Is it the best way to take it out?</p>
