    <p>Allied Gold has reported its financial and operational results for the second quarter of 2024, according to a report from the company s headquarters in the northern Côte d Ivoire. The company is expected to be involved in further exploration at Sadiola, the main ore processing plant in Sadiolana. These are the key highlights of the BBC.
