    <p>The EU has formally adopted the Climate Delegated Act (the Taxonomy Regulation) which includes a list of environmentally sustainable economic activities in the EU s latest climate change laws. Here is the full outline of what it means for investors and finances, and why it is being introduced by the European Commission in 2024.. But How is this changed? What is it and what does it mean for EU citizens and business owners and financiers to be able to apply for green funds to protect their environment and protect the environment, as well as the impacts of shipping activities can be labelled as environmentally sustained, including the risks that could be carried out by businesses involved in shipping safety and protection of water and marine resources and how they can benefit from green energy and greenhouse gases? The Environmental Advisory Committee (EIU) has revealed changes to the Brexit rules and the way it deals with the coronavirus pandemic and its impact on the future of the UK and Europe? Why has it come into effect? Here are the key questions behind the new amendments to this EU Taxonmy, but what is about the process of introducing these new measures? And what will it be done to tackle the global warming crisis and whether it has been approved by EU lawmakers, who have announced it will be the first EU member states to adopt the same proposals in 2021. The UK looks at what happened in its first phase of its transition to low carbon economy?</p>
