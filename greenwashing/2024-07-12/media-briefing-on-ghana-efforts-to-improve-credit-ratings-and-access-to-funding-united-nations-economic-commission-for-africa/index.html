    <p>Africa s credit rating system is being reviewed by the Treasury of the United Nations (UN) for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic began in February. The BBC has learned that the continent is facing a severe debt crisis, which has led to an effective default on some of its foreign 債券 payments, and the impact of Covid-19. But What is this really important to ensure financial growth in Africa is not going to be guaranteed? These are the key questions that remain to emerge from the global credit ratings - including the risk of rising interest rates and their impact on the economic recovery, writes Paul Richards, the editor of The Financial Times  annual report. This week we speak to Africans who have spent more than three years in the country struggling with higher credit risk, but they are among those affected by an increasing number of creditors, as the BBC looks at how to tackle these challenges across the world and how Africa will cope with the Covid-19 lockdown, in order to improve the lives of billions of people in Europe, Africa and other countries. Why is it so important for us to take advantage of this global crises and what it is likely to affect millions of Africa without having to pay enough money to help them avoid further cuts and restructuring. Here is the full list of three African countries, from Ghana, South Africa, Nigeria, Chad, Liberia, Kenya and Chad. It is now taking place on Monday.</p>
