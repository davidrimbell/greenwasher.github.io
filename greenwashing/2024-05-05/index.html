Greenwashing is when companies pretend to be eco-friendly but actually harm the environment. They use vague claims, irrelevant certifications, and minor green initiatives to deceive.
Consumers should watch out for greenwashing to avoid being tricked by false sustainability claims. By understanding these strategies, they can make smart choices and support truly sustainable businesses.
One example of greenwashing is a fast fashion retailer promoting a small eco-friendly line while most products are harmful to the environment. Another is an energy company claiming to use renewable energy but still relies on fossil fuels.
Public perception affects greenwashing, as companies use false claims to appeal to sustainability-conscious consumers. This can damage trust in companies and hinder genuine sustainability efforts.

Companies use strategies like vague claims, irrelevant certifications, and minor green initiatives to deceive consumers. Lack of transparency is also common in greenwashing.
Consumers can spot greenwashing by researching a company&rsquo;s environmental practices, looking for specific claims, being wary of vague statements, and checking for reputable certifications.
Falling for greenwashing can mean supporting unsustainable companies, harming the environment, and hindering progress towards a truly sustainable future. It can also waste resources on products that don&rsquo;t align with environmental values.
