  <meta name="title" content="Greta Thunberg Arrested at Oil and Gas Protest in London, Calls Out &#34;Spineless Politicians&#34;"/>
  <meta name="description" content="Climate activist Greta Thunberg has once again made headlines, this time for her arrest at a protest outside an oil and gas conference in London. Thunberg and other demonstrators blocked entrances to the Intercontinental Hotel, where the conference was being held, in an effort to prevent delegates from entering. The protest was organized by climate group Fossil Free London, with Greenpeace also participating. Thunberg called out &ldquo;spineless politicians&rdquo; for meeting with oil industry lobbyists. This arrest is not the first for Thunberg, as she has been involved in previous climate protests and faced legal consequences. The protest in London is part of a three-day action to shut down the conference.
In contrast to Thunberg&rsquo;s activism, ZTE Corporation, a leading tech company, has been recognized for its outstanding achievement in Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) initiatives at the BDO ESG Awards 2023. ZTE has focused on green development and technological innovation to support global decarbonization efforts. The company has accumulated over 650 green innovation patents and has achieved a YoY decrease in greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption. ZTE has also gained recognition for its contribution to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and has been included in various sustainability indexes and lists. ZTE remains committed to low-carbon development and fulfilling its social responsibility as a technology company.
BETTER Climate Store is an online marketplace that aims to combat climate change and promote sustainability. The founders, experienced creative directors, use art, humor, and technology to address the serious issue of climate change. Proceeds from the store go to the BETTER Climate Fund, which supports climate mitigation projects. BETTER Climate Store brings a lightness and irreverence to the topic of climate change while making a positive impact.
SAP, a global leader in business software and technology, is helping companies tackle the challenges of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving net-zero goals. One of the main challenges is tracking and reporting Scope 3 emissions, which account for the majority of emissions in most companies. SAP, with access to extensive supply chain data, is developing sustainability solutions to help businesses manage these emissions. The challenges include understanding reporting requirements, collecting accurate emissions data, and organizing and using the data effectively. SAP&rsquo;s transactional carbon accounting approach allows companies to focus on reducing emissions in specific areas of their supply chain and gradually expand their efforts.
Seegene Inc., a leading South Korean company in PCR molecular diagnostics, has developed 100% recyclable packaging for its diagnostic kits. The packaging is made with eco-friendly and FSC-certified materials, meeting global environmental regulations. The design of the packaging allows for a 30% increase in load capacity and up to a 52% reduction in transportation costs. The packaging is composed of renewable or certified &ldquo;green&rdquo; materials and can maintain the necessary temperature for 140 hours. Seegene&rsquo;s eco-friendly shipping box has passed multiple performance tests and has received positive customer feedback. This initiative is part of Seegene&rsquo;s commitment to environmental sustainability and corporate governance.
In California, Governor Gavin Newsom has signed three new laws that establish comprehensive corporate climate disclosure requirements. These laws apply to large companies operating in California and those pursuing net zero or carbon neutral goals. The laws require disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions, the preparation of climate-related financial risk reports, and impose disclosure requirements on companies making net zero or carbon neutrality claims. These laws aim to increase transparency and accountability in corporate climate actions and will take effect in 2026.
These news stories highlight both positive and negative aspects of the ongoing battle against climate change. While activists like Greta Thunberg continue to fight for a more sustainable future, companies like ZTE and Seegene are making significant strides in environmental innovation. However, it is important to remain vigilant and aware of greenwashing, as companies may attempt to deceive consumers with false claims of sustainability. As consumers, we must continue to educate ourselves and support genuine efforts towards a greener and more sustainable world.
