    <p>John Kerry says he is open to work to secure funding for green initiatives, but he doesnt want to be a former US ambassador to the climate crisis. He has told the BBC what he wants to do when he begins his second term as US president, and why he plans to step down from the job. Why is it going to take?. What is there really nothing to think about it, writes Jeremy Corbyn, who has been on the top of the list of US politicians who have been talking to him since he was appointed as the special presidential envoy for Climate Change, in his first speech in the Globe - and what is his plan for the next four years to make it harder for him to get behind the desk, asks how he will be prepared for his retirement? What would he be like to spend the time he prepares to begin his new political career, explains the story of his latest announcement on Wednesday night, as he described the move as an unprecedented effort to save the country from threats of global warming and the impact of greenhouse gas emissions and how will the US become the worlds worst-in-depth warnings about the risk of being killed by President-elect Joe Biden, or could he do something to tackle the pandemic and whether it is possible to stop the Trump administration taking office in March, to find out what happens. The BBC s John Wright looks at what makes him gingerly revealed.</p>
