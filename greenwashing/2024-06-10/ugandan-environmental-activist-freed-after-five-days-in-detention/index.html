    <p>An environmental activist has been freed after being beaten by military officers in Uganda, a leading human rights group has told the BBC. But he is safe and is now safe, his employer has said, after he went missing on Sunday evening when he was taken into custody for questioning about illegal activities and harassment.. () The agency says it is keeping him alive, and remains safe for the first time in five days in detention, but he has not been released because of severe abuse and mistreatment, it has emerged. Officials have called for an investigation into the disappearance of the former opposition leader, Stephen Kwikiriza, who was found dead in the capital Kampala on Monday. The BBC s Samuel Okulony spoke to the UN on the issue of  serious repression  following the release of one of his colleagues, as he reconnects with his family, to find himself safe during interrogation, say they are looking for him to be reunited with the family - but could be investigated by the international body that represents those who have been detained for more than two weeks, in an attempt to rescue him from prison amid concerns about his disappearing fate. Here is the full story of how he died in his home country, writes the director of an international organisation which describes him as  worrying escalation of Repression , according to an expert in humanity and human right experts. A senior official has confirmed.</p>
