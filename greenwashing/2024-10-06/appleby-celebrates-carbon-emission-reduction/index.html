  <meta name="description" content=" Appleby has successfully retained its Planet Mark Business Certification for 2024, marking a significant achievement in its sustainability efforts. The company has managed to reduce its carbon emissions by 37.2%, demonstrating its commitment to environmental sustainability and responsible business practices. To maintain the Certification, Appleby had to measure and reduce emissions across the Group while improving data quality. Despite experiencing significant growth, Appleby achieved a 39.2% per employee reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions compared to the previous year.  The Planet Mark Certification serves as a recognized symbol of sustainability progress, assuring clients that Appleby s carbon footprint has been independently verified. This achievement contributes to Appleby s environmental, social, and governance (ESG) capabilities. Appleby Group Managing Partner Malcolm Moller expressed his delight in retaining the Certification and achieving such a substantial reduction in carbon emissions. He acknowledged the efforts of colleagues across the organization and emphasized the importance of continually reviewing progress.  Appleby s sustainability initiatives extend beyond reducing its carbon footprint. The company actively engages in community initiatives, supports charitable causes, and advocates for responsible business practices across its international network of offices.

This accomplishment highlights Appleby s dedication to sustainability and responsible business practices, setting a strong foundation for future decarbonization efforts.
