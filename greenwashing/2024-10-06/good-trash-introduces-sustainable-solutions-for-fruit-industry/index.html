  <meta name="description" content=" Good Trash, a sustainable circular solutions provider, showcased its innovative  good swag  collection at Asia Fruit Logistica (AFL) 2024 in Hong Kong. The collection, which includes high-visibility vests made from recycled plastic packaging, demonstrates the potential of upcycling to reduce environmental impact in the fruit industry. By converting waste packaging into branded merchandise like uniforms and tote bags, Good Trash addresses key Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) concerns.  The eye-catching vests, inspired by orchard uniforms, serve as a distinctive team uniform while highlighting the value of upcycling. The initiative has garnered significant attention from industry players, with fruit brands placing first orders for items from the  good swag  collection following the showcase at AFL.  Christiana Zhu, Co-Founder of Good Trash, emphasizes the company s goal to help customers achieve ESG points while meeting their commercial objectives. The food industry, responsible for up to 30% of global emissions, can benefit from Good Trash s approach to upcycling plastic waste and developing products from food waste.  Good Trash aims to simplify ESG implementation by offering practical solutions, such as upcycling plastic waste for marketing swag and innovating new products from food waste. The strong interest from the fruit industry at AFL 2024 demonstrates the potential for sustainable practices in the food and beverage industry.
