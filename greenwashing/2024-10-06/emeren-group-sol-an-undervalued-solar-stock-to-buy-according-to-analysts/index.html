Emeren (NYSE:SOL) has a diversified portfolio of 245MW of photovoltaic (PV) systems and 15MWh of storage systems, with a significant portion of its order backlog in Europe.  The company has been expanding its Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) services, which account for around 50% of its revenues. The demand for EPC services in the photovoltaic sector is growing, and Emeren (NYSE:SOL) is capitalizing on this trend, particularly in Europe.  Despite facing challenges related to project delays, Emeren (NYSE:SOL) is well-positioned for growth. The stock s forward PE of 8.37 represents a 58% discount to its sector median of 20.09.
