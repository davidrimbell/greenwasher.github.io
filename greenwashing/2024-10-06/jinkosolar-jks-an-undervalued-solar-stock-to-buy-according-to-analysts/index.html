  <meta name="description" content=" JinkoSolar (NYSE:JKS) is one of the leading solar companies globally, focusing on photovoltaic solar products. The company has set new records in cell efficiency, with its TOPCon technology expected to offer the best economic performance at a lower cost. JinkoSolar is also expanding its global presence, planning to establish a 10 GW solar cell and module factory in Saudi Arabia.  As of October 4, JinkoSolar s stock is trading at a forward P/E ratio of 11.37, representing a significant discount compared to the sector median of 23.68. The company is owned by 7 hedge funds, with a total value of $15.40 million as of the second quarter.  JinkoSolar ranks 7th on our list of the most undervalued solar stocks to buy according to analysts. However, it s important to note that our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns within a shorter timeframe.  In summary, JinkoSolar (NYSE:JKS) is a promising undervalued solar stock with significant growth potential. Its expansion plans and technological advancements position it well in the global solar market.
