  <meta name="description" content=" The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) New Zealand criticizes the Government s Fast-track Approvals Bill, which they claim will lead to significant environmental destruction and potential extinction of native species in Aotearoa. The Bill is set to expedite 149 infrastructure and development projects, including open-cast coal and gold mines, seabed mining, and salmon farming, all of which pose threats to rare wildlife and ecosystems.  WWF-New Zealand s CEO, Dr. Kayla Kingdon-Bebb, condemns the Government s actions, stating that the Bill strips local communities of their voice and enables environmental destruction unprecedented in Aotearoa. She argues that the Government s push for the Bill, which claims to support decarbonization, is a form of greenwashing, as it prioritizes short-term profits over long-term environmental sustainability.  The list of projects includes the Hananui salmon farm off Stewart Island/Rakiura, which has been rejected by independent experts due to its potential impact on marine mammals and seabirds. Another controversial project is Trans-Tasman Resources  seabed mining off the coast of Taranaki, which faces opposition from the offshore wind farm sector and local communities.  Kingdon-Bebb warns that the Government s decision to fast-track these projects without public input will lead to widespread opposition from New Zealanders. She believes that communities will stand up against these environmentally destructive projects, which pose a threat to the country s way of life.  In summary, the WWF New Zealand criticizes the Government s Fast-track Approvals Bill for its potential to cause irreversible damage to Aotearoa s native habitats and threatened species. The Bill s expedited approval of numerous projects, despite expert rejection and local opposition, is seen as a betrayal of democratic values and environmental stewardship."/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://green-washer.com/greenwashing/2024-10-06/a-dark-day-for-nature-and-democracy-fast-track-destruction-laid-bare/">
