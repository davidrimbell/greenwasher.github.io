  <meta name="description" content="  Industry,  an HBO series created by British writers Mickey Down and Konrad Kay, is a complex narrative that evolved from its initial portrayal of young graduates at a fictional American investment bank, Pierpoint. The show, which debuted in 2020, has been compared to  Euphoria,   Succession,  and  Mad Men,  with critics noting its raunchy British teen series parallels.  The third season of  Industry  marked a significant growth in ratings, despite its low budget and indie-style production. The series gained a larger audience and moved beyond its initial premise to offer a fresh and unique storytelling experience. The show s appeal lies in its exploration of the identities of three main characters: Harper Stern, Yasmin Kara-Hanami, and Robert Spearing, all of whom are underdogs navigating the ruthless culture of Pierpoint.  The season delves deeper into the characters  personal struggles, with Harper shedding her unhappy past and becoming more calculating, Yasmin grappling with her abusive father, and Robert learning about the predatory nature of Pierpoint s clients and colleagues. The supporting cast, including Ken Leung and Kit Harrington, deliver compelling performances that add depth to the show s complex human behavior.   Industry  also critiques the financial industry s obsession with ESG and DEI, portraying them as superficial masks for the industry s true ambitions. While the show may lack the meticulous research and accuracy of  Succession,  it successfully captures the emotional beats and offers a compelling narrative that sets it apart from other financial-themed series.  In conclusion,  Industry  is a unique and compelling series that explores the lives of young graduates in the cutthroat world of finance. Despite its low budget and indie-style production, the show has gained a larger audience and evolved into a fresh and different storytelling experience. While it may not be as gripping as  Succession,  it offers a compelling narrative that deserves recognition in its own right."/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://green-washer.com/greenwashing/2024-10-06/review-hbo-industry-is-getting-better-than-succession/">
