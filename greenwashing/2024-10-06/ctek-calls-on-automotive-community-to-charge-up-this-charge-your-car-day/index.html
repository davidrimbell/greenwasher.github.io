  <meta name="description" content=" Charge Your Car Day, celebrated on October 5th, is an initiative by CTEK, a global leader in battery charging solutions, to emphasize the importance of regular battery maintenance for vehicles. With the cost of replacing a car s battery potentially exceeding $200, this maintenance is crucial for households managing their cash flow. Despite 91% of drivers having experienced a dead battery at some point, only 2% check their battery before long trips and 72% never use a charger to maintain battery health.  The event highlights the need for preventive measures, as 65% of American motorists only consider their car battery when it fails, leading to missed appointments or late arrivals. CTEK s CS FREE® and Ready comfort connectors offer safe, intelligent charging solutions that are comparable in cost to traditional chargers.  Unexpected breakdowns can strain household finances, making it more cost-effective to prevent issues than to rectify them. CTEK s CS FREE® adaptive booster provides a safer and gentler start, reducing the risk of damaging the battery or causing electrical system issues.  CTEK has been supporting the automotive community for over 26 years, ensuring their products are ready for future charging needs. The company s commitment to innovation and sustainable solutions is evident in their E-mobility solutions, which range from individual EV chargers to large-scale installations.
