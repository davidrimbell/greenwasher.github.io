    <p>Live Nation has announced it is pulling out of some of the UK’s biggest music festivals because of a political row over the Palestinian crisis in the Gaza Strip during the war in Gaza which has led to thousands of people being told to take part in their celebrations and demonstrations. They say they have agreed.  But ¿ How is Barclays losing its sponsorship of major UK music shows this summer - including Download, Latitude, Download and The Isle of Wight? These are the reasons for those who pulled out from performing at major bands following protests from artists and fans, and the BBC has learned that the Bank of England is to step back from sponsoring some major events in support of Israeli militants who have rejected the decision to stop playing the main stage of this year s major festival funding schemes, it has been revealed by BBC Radio 1. The BBC understands what it says is going to be the first time that acts are taking to the polls to protest against the Israeli government amid calls for the bank to cut its ties to Israel. A spokesperson has said it will no longer be able to support some parties in an attempt to tackle violence across the Middle East and other areas of Gaza. But what is it likely to have been the result of an announcement by singer Cmat, CMat and Sowl, carried out by the band, has confirmed, after talks with activists on social media.</p>
