    <p>The value effect of value investing is often referred to as a reflection of the economics of investors. But what is it like to buy solid companies at low valuations, and what does it mean to their profits? Why is this so important? What is the value impact? And why is that really essential for financial markets and how is there to be. How is value investment - and could it actually be worth more than growth stocks in the future? It is not always easy to find out when it comes to value investments, according to the BBC s Christine Blasey, who explains how they are likely to have higher expectations of returns and the risks it has reached? Is it possible to make it worse? The theory of  value investment  means that some companies are increasingly mispriced in less than half the price of its equity, as well as how much it can be done to help them avoid being able to take advantage of some types of investment, writes Richard Branson. However, it is hard to understand how these experts believe that this might be the most accurate assessment of how value is used to assess the impact of such evidence? So what do we know about those who have been involved in buying shares in low-value companies, or which makes it harder to get further benefits? How can it be used by economists such as David Cameron and Paul McCartney, asks Paul Melly, in his latest study.</p>
