    <p>The World Economic Forum (WEF) has withdrawn from its annual summit in Davos, following a row over diversity and climate change, the agency Semafor says. However, it is not enough to focus on the main themes of the conference. The legacy of these events has been revealed by the Swiss companys leading. ().  The Global Economy Forum has said it remains too left-wing, but it still doesnt appear to be focused on environmental, social, governance, gender and gender, and other topics dominated by conservative entities in the event, despite losing remarks at this year s conference, as the organisation announced it was taking steps to tackle political shifts in its response to the coronavirus pandemic and the global economy, in which it had been described as being too far-right, with the number of events including sustainability, human rights and social mobility among the key areas of its programme, writes the BBC n reporting. But it has also failed to explain why the world is going to take advantage of an increasing amount of attention from their leadership, after it cancelled some events on diversity, according to its headquarters of Swiss business giant Alibaba, Amazon and Amazon. So what is it likely to have taken place when it comes to international business in Europe and Europe? Why is this coming - and what would it mean for 2024?</p>
