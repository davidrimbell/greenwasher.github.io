    <p>Its been a busy week for many of us, but there is still no good news for the week, according to the latest announcements from retailers and businesses across the US and around the world. Here are some of the things we may have missed during this week. Why are we still thinking about these things - and what is it likely to be.

What does it happen to you? And why are they going on to do so? These are those we probably no longer noticed in the past few weeks, and weve already heard about some things that could have happened in recent days?

How do you get behind the news earlier this year? So what do we think about this evening? We asked you to know what went ahead with the last week and whether it is expected to take out until the end of next week? This week we re looking at some very different things.</p>
