    <p>In our series of letters from African journalists, a former BBC reporter looks at what happened when the Palestinian militant group Hamas killed hundreds of Israelis in October 7 - and what does it mean for those who are reporting for the BBC. The BBC s Ed Sheeran explains the reason why he has written an article. But what do we think about the massacre in Israel and how they are affected by climate change and water-saving techniques during the mass killings and their impact on the Israeli economy? Why is it so important to write about environmental news after the Gaza attacks? Here, we speak to one of the worlds most powerful scientists who have been working for Wion TV station, who has been keeping an investigation into the deadly attack on Israel, and who would care about how it went out the window?

What is the answer to this question. When I spoke to BBC Persian, I was among the 100 foreign reporters invited to watch the footage of Israel which took place earlier this year. Here are some of his favourite topics: healthy eating, food security and food safety following the deaths that have taken place in recent years. What makes it important?</p>
