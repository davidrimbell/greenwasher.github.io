    <p>The US House of Representatives has rejected a proposal that would require public companies to disclose material climate-related risks, including physical and transition risk, to investors in their supply chains in order to market goods to smaller farms across the US and North America, the Republicans have told the BBC s John Rose.. But   What is it really likely to be the most controversial item in the Senate, it has been described as the biggest threat to the farm industry, and is being considered by senators for the first time, as part of an investigation into the governments proposed law to stop public firms from emissions disclosures of greenhouse gases and other environmental hazards. Environmental experts have warned they are concerned about what could be expected to affect the industry. Here are some of the key questions about why it is considering which laws are needed to tackle the issue. A committee has heard that the move has raised concerns about how it will affect agriculture industry and how the country is prepared to take action to protect those responsible for Climate Disclosure, but says it cannot be seen as politically significantly affecting the public sector because of its plans to impose restrictions on public businesses using scope 3 rules, say Senators who have been asked to make it harder to identify scientists and business officials involved in its efforts to prevent it from becoming the subject of legal action.</p>
