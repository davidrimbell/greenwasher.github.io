The company is to become the first in the world to acquire lithium and other critical minerals and metals in North and South America.. Here is the latest announcement of changes to the company. Here are some of the key takeaways from the new corporate growth phases, and what is it likely to be known as the  Maverick  - and why is this changing? The BBC has learned about the impacts of this move on the global market and the future of its business being taken over by Canadians who are taking their own steps towards developing innovative investments in Canada, Canada and North America, as part of an effort to revive the business.
