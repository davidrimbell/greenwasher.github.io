    <p>Turkeys lawyers are seeing welcome signs of a return to relative stability, as well as their efforts to help those affected by the devastating earthquakes and May s presidential elections. But what is it like for them to rebuild the Turkish legal community, and why are they getting back on these matters?.

The BBC looks at what could be the most significant challenges to tackle the problem and how does it actually affect the legal fraternity reaching the same heights?
