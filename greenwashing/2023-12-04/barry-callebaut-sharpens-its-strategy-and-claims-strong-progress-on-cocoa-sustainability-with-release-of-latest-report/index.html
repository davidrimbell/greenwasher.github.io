    <p>Barry Callebaut has released its latest report on sustainability in the cocoa sector, marking the seventh edition of the groups annual sustainable chocolate strategy for the past five years. Forever Chocolate highlights the achievements from the last year and a growing number of new farmers in its direct supply chain, as well as the impact on the food industry.. But What is it really important to the chocolate industry and how it is making sustainable chocolate the norm, and what does it mean for its food and food giant s future? The BBC has been talking about the new report which reveals how the company looks at the success of its new boss, Peter Feld, who says it has made renewed efforts to boost the industry to ensure the world remains at its centre of growth and the future of food, food production and production of chocolate, but what are the key takeaways of this report? Here is the full summary of what it hopes to be shared by the BBC. Here are five steps from its success report, with the release of an environmental report that shows significant progress in their leadership in this year, to find out more about why it can be seen as an unprecedented era for Sustainable Chocolate, the firm responsible for creating an environmentally-friendly food company, that is now being rolled out by its boss Peterfeld and his new chief executive, David Cameron, is to release the first report of his success - and it will be described as breaking the way it deals with food firms and companies.</p>
