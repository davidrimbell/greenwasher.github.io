  <meta name="description" content=" CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust (CICT) and InvenTrust Properties (IVT) are both real estate companies, but they differ in several key aspects.  Institutional and Insider Ownership: IVT has a higher institutional ownership (61.7%) compared to CICT (20.1%). This suggests that IVT may be perceived as having more potential for long-term growth.  Valuation and Earnings: IVT has higher revenue ($263.01 million) and earnings ($5.27 million) than CICT. However, CICT has a lower price-to-earnings ratio (9.93), indicating it is more affordable.  Analyst Ratings: IVT has a consensus target price of $31.33, suggesting a potential upside of 6.32%. This indicates that analysts believe IVT has more growth potential than CICT.  Dividends: CICT pays a higher dividend yield (6.0%) and a lower payout ratio (59.1%) compared to IVT (3.1% yield and 900.0% payout ratio). This suggests that CICT is a more reliable dividend stock.  In summary, InvenTrust Properties (IVT) outperforms CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust (CICT) in terms of institutional ownership, revenue, earnings, and analyst ratings. However, CICT has a more favorable dividend profile. Investors should consider their priorities when choosing between these two real estate companies. If growth potential and higher earnings are the main focus, IVT may be the better choice. If a reliable dividend and lower valuation are more important, CICT may be the preferred option."/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://green-washer.com/greenwashing/2024-10-05/head-to-head-analysis-capitaland-integrated-commercial-trust-otcmkts-cpamf-versus-inventrust-properties-nyse-ivt/">
