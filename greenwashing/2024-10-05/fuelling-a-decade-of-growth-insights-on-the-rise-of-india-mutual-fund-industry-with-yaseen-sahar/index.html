  <meta name="description" content=" Over the past decade, India s mutual fund industry has experienced significant growth, with assets under management (AUM) increasing from ₹8.25 trillion in 2014 to over ₹66 trillion by August 2024. This growth has been driven by factors such as increased investor awareness, a rising middle class, and supportive regulatory policies. Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) have played a crucial role in boosting retail participation, with SIP inflows reaching ₹23,000 crores per month in July 2024.  The mutual fund distribution community has been instrumental in this growth, particularly in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, where they have worked to educate and build trust with new investors. Regulatory changes, such as SEBI s categorization of mutual fund schemes in 2017, have also contributed to a more transparent and accessible market.  Investors have embraced mutual funds as a means of wealth creation, with a shift from traditional assets like gold and real estate to financial products. Yaseen Sahar, an industry leader with over two decades of experience, has emphasized the importance of financial literacy and education in promoting informed decision-making among investors.  Key numbers highlighting the industry s growth include the increase in SIP accounts from 2.6 crore in 2017 to over 6.5 crore today.
