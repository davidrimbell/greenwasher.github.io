  <meta name="description" content="In today&rsquo;s world, it&rsquo;s important to understand &lsquo;greenwashing.&rsquo; This is when companies make it seem like they are helping the environment, but they really aren&rsquo;t. They use tricks in their ads to make people think they care about being green.
One way they do this is by using unclear words. For example, a company might call a product &ldquo;eco-friendly&rdquo; without saying why it&rsquo;s good for the environment. They might also focus on one green part of a product and ignore the rest. This can trick people into thinking they are making good choices for the Earth.
Think about a big oil company that talks a lot about its green projects. They might invest in renewable energy, but they still spend a lot on oil and gas. This makes it look like they care about the environment, but their main business hasn&rsquo;t changed. This shows how people can be fooled into supporting companies that aren&rsquo;t really green.
It&rsquo;s important to know about these tricks because they affect what we buy and the planet. When people think they are helping the environment, they might actually be causing harm. By learning about greenwashing, we can make better choices and make sure companies do what they say.
Public opinion matters a lot in greenwashing. Companies need people to trust them to keep selling their products. If people find out a company is being sneaky, they might stop buying from them. For example, when a popular clothing brand was accused of greenwashing, people stopped buying their clothes. This made the company change its ways.
By looking at these examples, we see how important it is to pay attention. As buyers, we can ask companies to be honest and clear. This helps create a more truthful market, where our choices match our values and help the planet.

    <br/> Al Gore, a prominent figure in climate change advocacy, appears onscreen via Zoom, instantly recognizable by his distinctive Tennessee accent and a backdrop displaying an image of Earth s troposphere, the thin blue line separating the planet s lower atmosphere from outer space. Gore emphasizes the significance of this layer, explaining that it contains the air we breathe and is so thin that a car traveling at interstate highway speeds would reach the top of this line in just five to seven minutes. He criticizes the troposphere as an  open sewer  for the accumulation of fossil fuel pollution.  Gore, at the age of 76, has been a vocal proponent of addressing climate change for many years. His efforts gained widespread attention with the release of his Oscar-winning documentary,  An Inconvenient Truth,  in 2006. This film played a crucial role in raising public awareness about the urgent need to combat global warming and its potential consequences.  Throughout his career, Gore has consistently highlighted the importance of taking immediate action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition to renewable energy sources. He has worked tirelessly to educate people about the dangers of climate change and the necessity of implementing sustainable practices to protect the planet for future generations.  Gore s dedication to the cause of climate change has not only earned him recognition as an environmental activist but also as a leader in the global effort to address this pressing issue. His work continues to inspire others to join the fight against climate change and strive for a more sustainable and resilient world.

    <br/> The mining industry faces significant environmental, social, and governance (ESG) challenges, with these factors dominating the risk landscape for the third consecutive year. EY Canada s report on the  Top 10 Risks and Opportunities in Mining  highlights the complexities miners face in 2024, with a growing degree of both complexity and investor attention. This shift is expected to drive innovation, ambitious targets, and greater transparency in reporting.  Environmental risks include waste management and water stewardship, with the industry managing over 200 billion tonnes of tailings and billions more anticipated. Innovations like the  Mining Microbiome Analytics Platform  showcase the sector s commitment to non-chemical extraction and remediation strategies. Water stewardship is also a critical area, with stringent water usage policies in countries like Chile.  Social risks focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&amp;I), health and wellbeing, and human rights. While there has been some improvement in female participation in C-suite roles, overall diversity remains low. Health and wellbeing initiatives are expanding, addressing mental health challenges of Fly-in fly-out (FIFO) workers. Human rights scrutiny is increasing, with a lackluster average score of 22% in human rights performance across the sector.  Governance challenges revolve around measurement and monitoring, with the plethora of regulations and frameworks creating a complex environment for the industry to navigate. Establishing credible baselines and integrating considerations throughout the mine lifecycle are essential for maintaining integrity and achieving global ESG sustainability standards.  In conclusion, the mining industry must embrace change to navigate the complex ESG landscape, ensuring sustainable operations that align with global standards and stakeholder expectations. Theo Yameogo, the Americas mining &amp; metals leader at EY, emphasizes the need for increased innovation, collaboration, and agility in the upcoming years.

    <a href="https://green-washer.com/greenwashing/2024-10-05/esg-frameworks-can-still-support-the-achievement-of-circularity/">ESG frameworks can still support the achievement of circularity</a>
    <br/> The circular economy has become a key focus in sustainability efforts due to environmental and economic concerns. It emphasizes closed-loop processes to extend resource life, maximize economic benefits, and minimize environmental impacts. The World Economic Forum s reports highlight the potential cost of climate change, estimated at $1.7 to $3.1 trillion per year by 2050, underscoring the urgency for sustainable practices.  Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) frameworks are gaining traction as a solution to the challenges of decarbonization. These frameworks, which include metrics and reporting standards, are voluntary or mandated and have financial implications. ESG-oriented investing has grown significantly, with assets reaching $30 trillion, up 68% since 2014. Consumer demand for sustainable products is also on the rise, with 46% of consumers worldwide stating they intentionally buy more sustainable products.  ESG frameworks inherently support circularity principles, such as reducing resource consumption, reusing materials and parts, and recycling for value creation and proper disposal. They offer internal benefits like reduced operating expenses, enhanced employee retention, and opportunities for social license to operate. However, the diversity of ESG frameworks and their application across different industries and jurisdictions can pose challenges.  Despite these challenges, ESG frameworks remain a viable starting point for addressing the circularity gap. Innovation in ESG evaluation, guidance, and adoption tools is ongoing, with organizations like Cambrian College s Centre for Smart Mining (CSM) working with mining groups to develop clean and green extraction methods.  In the Canadian context, ESG frameworks can differentiate Canadian mining operations on the global stage. By promoting innovation in recycling, energy efficiency, and closed-loop supply chains, Canadian mining can position itself as a leader in sustainable resource management.  While the circular economy remains the long-term goal, ESG frameworks can guide organizations towards sustainable practices and help bridge the gap between current practices and a more circular economy. A continued commitment to ESG adoption is essential for achieving this goal.

    <br/> Over the past decade, India s mutual fund industry has experienced significant growth, with assets under management (AUM) increasing from ₹8.25 trillion in 2014 to over ₹66 trillion by August 2024. This growth has been driven by factors such as increased investor awareness, a rising middle class, and supportive regulatory policies. Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) have played a crucial role in boosting retail participation, with SIP inflows reaching ₹23,000 crores per month in July 2024.  The mutual fund distribution community has been instrumental in this growth, particularly in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, where they have worked to educate and build trust with new investors. Regulatory changes, such as SEBI s categorization of mutual fund schemes in 2017, have also contributed to a more transparent and accessible market.  Investors have embraced mutual funds as a means of wealth creation, with a shift from traditional assets like gold and real estate to financial products. Yaseen Sahar, an industry leader with over two decades of experience, has emphasized the importance of financial literacy and education in promoting informed decision-making among investors.  Key numbers highlighting the industry s growth include the increase in SIP accounts from 2.6 crore in 2017 to over 6.5 crore today. Looking ahead, Sahar predicts that ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) factors and thematic funds will continue to gain traction, with passive investing through index funds and ETFs also expected to grow.  To ensure continued trust and growth in a highly competitive landscape, transparency, regular communication, and education are essential. Technology, such as AI-driven tools, can also help personalize investment advice and improve decision-making.  In summary, the remarkable growth of India s mutual fund industry over the past decade is a testament to the collective efforts of investors, distributors, and regulators. With trends like ESG investing and the rise of passive funds on the horizon, the potential for continued expansion is

    <br/> CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust (CICT) and InvenTrust Properties (IVT) are both real estate companies, but they differ in several key aspects.  Institutional and Insider Ownership: IVT has a higher institutional ownership (61.7%) compared to CICT (20.1%). This suggests that IVT may be perceived as having more potential for long-term growth.  Valuation and Earnings: IVT has higher revenue ($263.01 million) and earnings ($5.27 million) than CICT. However, CICT has a lower price-to-earnings ratio (9.93), indicating it is more affordable.  Analyst Ratings: IVT has a consensus target price of $31.33, suggesting a potential upside of 6.32%. This indicates that analysts believe IVT has more growth potential than CICT.  Dividends: CICT pays a higher dividend yield (6.0%) and a lower payout ratio (59.1%) compared to IVT (3.1% yield and 900.0% payout ratio). This suggests that CICT is a more reliable dividend stock.  In summary, InvenTrust Properties (IVT) outperforms CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust (CICT) in terms of institutional ownership, revenue, earnings, and analyst ratings. However, CICT has a more favorable dividend profile. Investors should consider their priorities when choosing between these two real estate companies. If growth potential and higher earnings are the main focus, IVT may be the better choice. If a reliable dividend and lower valuation are more important, CICT may be the preferred option.

    <br/> Google CEO Sundar Pichai revealed in an interview that Google is exploring nuclear energy as a potential  green  source to power its AI data centers. This comes amidst the company s ambitious goal to achieve net-zero emissions by 2030, despite a 48% increase in greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 compared to 2019. Pichai mentioned that Google is considering additional investments in solar and evaluating technologies like small modular nuclear reactors.  The tech giant s interest in nuclear energy follows Microsoft s agreement to power its AI data centers with dormant Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania. Additionally, Sam Altman-backed Nuclear SMR company Oklo has finalized an agreement with the Department of Energy to advance the next phase of the SMR at the Idaho National Lab. Furthermore, the Biden administration has closed a $1.52 billion loan with Holtec s Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan to revive it.  Michael Alkin, Chief Investment Officer at Sachem Cove Partners, sees the Microsoft-Three Mile Island deal as a wake-up call for those not paying attention to the increasing demand for uranium. The restart of Three Mile Island  takes that to a bit of a different level,  as the funding markets are becoming more receptive to nuclear deals. Goldman s latest note on uranium prices suggests that they are expected to  stairstep  higher over time.  In summary, Google is exploring nuclear energy as a potential  green  source to power its AI data centers, following Microsoft s agreement with the dormant Three Mile Island nuclear plant. The interest in nuclear energy is driven by the need to achieve ambitious net-zero emissions goals and the increasing demand for uranium. The funding markets are also becoming more receptive to nuclear deals, as seen in the Microsoft-Three Mile Island agreement and the Biden administration s loan to Holtec s Palisades nuclear plant.

    <br/> The Brahma Mantra for mankind, as articulated by R Gopalakrishnan, emphasizes the importance of leaders with humane, compassionate, and no-nonsense thinking in the era of artificial intelligence (AI). Gopalakrishnan, despite his lack of technical expertise, contributed to discussions on AI at a security conference, highlighting the need for leaders to understand user perspectives and the political and social implications of technology.  The mantra underscores the significance of natural intelligence, which encompasses humanism, conscience, and compassion, in guiding the development and application of AI. Gopalakrishnan warns against the hype surrounding AI and the fear of its potential to overshadow human intelligence. He points to historical examples, such as Stanislav Petrov s decision to question the authenticity of a false alarm during the Cold War, as instances where human judgment prevailed over technology.  Gopalakrishnan also draws attention to the four ascending stages of the human mind: thinking, ego, intellect, and consciousness. He suggests that consciousness, which hosts the potent chitta, is unlikely to be replicated by AI in the foreseeable future. He advocates for the globalization of humanism and compassion as essential attributes for humanity s survival in the face of technological advancements.  In conclusion, Gopalakrishnan s Brahma Mantra for mankind calls for leaders to prioritize humane, compassionate, and no-nonsense thinking in the development and application of AI. He emphasizes the importance of natural intelligence, humanism, and compassion in guiding technological progress and warns against the hype surrounding AI. The mantra serves as a reminder that human judgment and values should remain at the forefront of technological advancements.

    <br/> The retail industry is experiencing rapid developments in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, driven by consumer demand for sustainability and ethical practices. RPC s Retail Compass highlights the importance of ESG in shaping the future of retail and consumer markets. As public interest in sustainability grows, with 64% of global consumers concerned about environmental issues, retailers have the opportunity to build customer loyalty and demonstrate commitment to meaningful change.  Regulatory changes, such as the EU Eco-design Regulation and the Green Claims Code, are pushing retailers towards more sustainable practices. Mandatory Scope 3 carbon reporting is also increasing transparency and encouraging customers to make sustainable choices.  Technological advancements, including AI and blockchain, are transforming the customer experience by enabling shoppers to find businesses and products that align with their values. This shift is not only beneficial for consumers but also for retailers, as strong ESG practices can help establish a positive brand reputation, attract and retain top talent, and drive business growth.  Ciara Cullen, a partner in RPC s Retail &amp; Consumer group, emphasizes that ESG is a strategic imperative that impacts every aspect of retail and consumer companies. By embracing sustainability and social responsibility, retailers can navigate changes in regulation and consumer behavior, ultimately benefiting both their business and the environment.  In summary, the retail industry is facing a pivotal moment as ESG factors become increasingly important for consumers and regulators alike. Retailers that prioritize sustainability and ethical practices will be better positioned to thrive in this evolving landscape, while those that fail to adapt may face reputational and financial risks.

    <br/> The supplier database is a critical component of effective supplier relationship management (SRM), enabling businesses to manage day-to-day relationships with strategic suppliers more efficiently. By integrating identity resolution and data from third-party providers, companies can identify unforeseen issues and maintain a single source of truth. Advanced analytics further facilitate the monitoring of trends and changes, allowing for quicker identification of escalation needs and enhancing proactive risk management.  To ensure suppliers consistently meet business standards, organizations must implement effective SRM practices. This includes streamlining compliance through documentation automation, tracking regulatory changes, and monitoring procurement processes. The digital transformation of procurement functions provides decision-makers with the necessary oversight and data to avoid risks in their supply chain environments.  Recent incidents involving large retailers highlight the importance of proactive monitoring and addressing procurement issues, as they can quickly become headline news stories and cause reputational damage. Having the right SaaS solution in place can help manage this process more effectively.  Prioritizing risk management in procurement functions is crucial in an uncertain global operating environment. Organizations must be prepared to swiftly mitigate risks, such as ESG concerns and changing legal requirements. Risk management should also encompass contingency planning to prepare teams for supplier failures or emergencies.  In conclusion, businesses must prioritize risk management in their procurement functions to stay ahead and maintain control over their operations and supply chain environments. By leveraging supplier databases, advanced analytics, and the right SaaS solutions, companies can effectively manage supplier relationships, ensure compliance, and mitigate risks in their procurement processes.

    <br/> Yokogawa Electric Corporation has introduced a new ATEX-compliant wireless steam trap monitoring device as part of its Sushi Sensor range, specifically designed for steam trap status monitoring in steam piping systems. Developed in collaboration with Armstrong International, this product aims to address the high costs and labor-intensive nature of current steam trap inspections.  Steam traps are crucial components in various equipment, such as heat exchangers and humidifiers, as they remove condensate and ensure efficient heat transfer. Failures in steam traps can lead to significant energy losses, costing tens of thousands to millions of US dollars annually. The new device offers automatic detection of steam trap status using high-quality temperature and acoustic sensors, capable of functioning in environments with a maximum steam temperature of 440°C.  The device utilizes long-range wireless LoRaWAN communication, allowing it to monitor equipment over distances of up to around 1km. This feature enables the installation of monitoring devices at various locations, connecting them to a single gateway and reducing network construction costs.  By integrating this device with Yokogawa s on-premise GA10 data logging software or similar cloud-based software, centralized monitoring of steam traps and other equipment can be achieved. This not only improves inspection consistency but also reduces the need for frequent on-site inspections.  Hiroshi Tanoguchi, Yokogawa s vice president and executive officer, emphasized the company s commitment to enriching the Sushi Sensor family of solutions and providing energy monitoring solutions based on steam trap status. This will help customers calculate projected energy losses in monetary terms and create maintenance plans, prioritizing high-risk equipment.  The new product is currently available in Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Saudi Arabia, with plans to release it in the USA, Europe, and India in compliance with various explosion-protected standards. This innovative solution aims to help customers reduce greenhouse gas emissions and achieve their ESG management targets.
