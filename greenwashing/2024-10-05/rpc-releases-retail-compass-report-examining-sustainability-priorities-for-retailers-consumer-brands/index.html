  <meta name="description" content=" The retail industry is experiencing rapid developments in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, driven by consumer demand for sustainability and ethical practices. RPC s Retail Compass highlights the importance of ESG in shaping the future of retail and consumer markets. As public interest in sustainability grows, with 64% of global consumers concerned about environmental issues, retailers have the opportunity to build customer loyalty and demonstrate commitment to meaningful change.  Regulatory changes, such as the EU Eco-design Regulation and the Green Claims Code, are pushing retailers towards more sustainable practices. Mandatory Scope 3 carbon reporting is also increasing transparency and encouraging customers to make sustainable choices.  Technological advancements, including AI and blockchain, are transforming the customer experience by enabling shoppers to find businesses and products that align with their values. This shift is not only beneficial for consumers but also for retailers, as strong ESG practices can help establish a positive brand reputation, attract and retain top talent, and drive business growth.  Ciara Cullen, a partner in RPC s Retail &amp; Consumer group, emphasizes that ESG is a strategic imperative that impacts every aspect of retail and consumer companies. By embracing sustainability and social responsibility, retailers can navigate changes in regulation and consumer behavior, ultimately benefiting both their business and the environment.  In summary, the retail industry is facing a pivotal moment as ESG factors become increasingly important for consumers and regulators alike. Retailers that prioritize sustainability and ethical practices will be better positioned to thrive in this evolving landscape, while those that fail to adapt may face reputational and financial risks."/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://green-washer.com/greenwashing/2024-10-05/rpc-releases-retail-compass-report-examining-sustainability-priorities-for-retailers-consumer-brands/">
