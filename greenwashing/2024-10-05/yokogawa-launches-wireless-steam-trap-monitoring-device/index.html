  <meta name="description" content=" Yokogawa Electric Corporation has introduced a new ATEX-compliant wireless steam trap monitoring device as part of its Sushi Sensor range, specifically designed for steam trap status monitoring in steam piping systems. Developed in collaboration with Armstrong International, this product aims to address the high costs and labor-intensive nature of current steam trap inspections.  Steam traps are crucial components in various equipment, such as heat exchangers and humidifiers, as they remove condensate and ensure efficient heat transfer. Failures in steam traps can lead to significant energy losses, costing tens of thousands to millions of US dollars annually. The new device offers automatic detection of steam trap status using high-quality temperature and acoustic sensors, capable of functioning in environments with a maximum steam temperature of 440°C.  The device utilizes long-range wireless LoRaWAN communication, allowing it to monitor equipment over distances of up to around 1km. This feature enables the installation of monitoring devices at various locations, connecting them to a single gateway and reducing network construction costs.  By integrating this device with Yokogawa s on-premise GA10 data logging software or similar cloud-based software, centralized monitoring of steam traps and other equipment can be achieved. This not only improves inspection consistency but also reduces the need for frequent on-site inspections.  Hiroshi Tanoguchi, Yokogawa s vice president and executive officer, emphasized the company s commitment to enriching the Sushi Sensor family of solutions and providing energy monitoring solutions based on steam trap status. This will help customers calculate projected energy losses in monetary terms and create maintenance plans, prioritizing high-risk equipment.  The new product is currently available in Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Saudi Arabia, with plans to release it in the USA, Europe, and India in compliance with various explosion-protected standards. This innovative solution aims to help customers reduce greenhouse gas emissions and achieve their ESG management targets."/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://green-washer.com/greenwashing/2024-10-05/yokogawa-launches-wireless-steam-trap-monitoring-device/">
