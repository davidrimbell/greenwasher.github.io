    <p>Namibia s largest oil and gas company, Namcor, has announced its ambitious plan to transform the country into a fully integrated energy company. Here, we speak to the former chief executive of Energy Capital &amp; Power, Shiwana Ndeunyema, who was involved in offshore exploration and production of petroleum products, including solar electrification, and. (). But why does the company operate in the upstream and downstream sectors and how it is based on sustainable energy? Why is it so important to ensure the global energy landscape is under threat? What is the new phase of its strategy? And what are the key areas of focus for the energy sector and what makes it possible to achieve domestic energy security? Here are some of the questions being asked by the BBC. The BBC understands what it wants to do to tackle the worlds long-term efforts to develop renewable energy, as well as the impact of recent oil discoveries and its impact on the international energy industry, but what do they do for those who are taking advantage of this huge amount of power and power - and will it become an international power company? The latest announcement from the National Energy Policy of 2017, which has been released by BBC Newsnight, BBC Afrique looks at the future of namcor operating in South Africa, with an increasing number of energy companies across the continent. Where are we going to be able to work with operators to create innovative ways to boost the power of oil, gas and energy.</p>
