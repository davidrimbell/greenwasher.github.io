  <meta name="description" content="The fashion industry&rsquo;s sustainability commitments are falling short, with emissions on the rise and garments contributing to deforestation, nature loss, and water pollution. Most clothing ends up in landfills in poor countries, highlighting the industry&rsquo;s deceptive practices. In response, Europe&rsquo;s regulators are taking action with 16 pieces of legislation in the works. LVMH&rsquo;s Antoine Arnault has called for a luxury-only sustainability pact, recognizing the need for the fashion industry&rsquo;s marketing machine to promote sustainable behaviors. However, the question of funding for sustainability efforts remains largely unaddressed.
Indie Semiconductor has published its first Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) report, showcasing its commitment to environmental sustainability, social responsibility, and corporate governance. By emphasizing its dedication to these areas, the company aims to avoid misrepresentation and deceit in conducting business globally.
Glencore CEO Gary Nagle has criticized European investors for prioritizing ESG factors over financial returns, accusing them of dishonesty. He defends U.S. investors as more pragmatic and focused on yield. Nagle&rsquo;s remarks come as some oil and gas majors, such as Shell and BP, have higher valuations in the United States despite softening their climate commitments. Glencore is not actively considering a move to New York but may consider it in the future if they feel they are not receiving recognition, valuation, and capital in London.
South Africa has the potential to become a renewable energy giant within five years, according to Gareth Rees, Head of Sustainability Strategy at Deloitte. This highlights the opportunity for genuine sustainability efforts and the importance of avoiding greenwashing.

Experts emphasized the need for proactive sustainability efforts and strong leadership in dealing with crises, promoting transparency and integrity in the face of potential fraud.
In her book &ldquo;Fighting to Breathe,&rdquo; anthropologist Nicole Fabricant explores youth activism and environmental justice in the South Baltimore Peninsula.

This research contributes to understanding the challenges and successes of the movement, shedding light on the importance of honesty and authenticity in addressing environmental and climate justice.
Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) is planning to change its methodology for its Environmental &amp; Social Disclosure QualityScore (ISS QualityScore) to improve its measures of corporate disclosure practices. This move aims to combat false advertising and deceit by encouraging companies to review and verify their data to ensure compliance with the updated methodology. The ISS QualityScore helps institutional investors compare environmental and social risks through company disclosures, promoting transparency and discouraging greenwashing.
Rogers Corporation has issued an update to its 2021 Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Report, highlighting its commitment to corporate responsibility and sustainability. By extending reporting quality and including third-party verification of greenhouse gas inventories, the company aims to avoid misrepresentation and dishonesty.

ESG.org has launched a new resource called WhatisESG to support ESG practitioners by providing research materials, presentation materials, and educational content. This initiative aims to combat eco-washing and sustainability washing by compiling reputable sources and categorizing them in an easy-to-use format. The organization hopes that ESG practitioners will find WhatisESG to be a valuable tool in promoting genuine sustainability efforts.
Low emission zones (LEZs) and congestion charging zones (CCZs) have been found to reduce cardiovascular disease and road traffic injuries in multiple cities across the UK, Europe, and Asia.

However, continued monitoring and evaluation are necessary to address any unintended consequences, such as the minor increase in bicycle and motorcycle injuries and deaths in London.
Samenta, the Small and Medium Enterprises Association of Malaysia, is committed to assisting SMEs in understanding digitalization, automation, and meeting ESG standards. By supporting these businesses in overcoming challenges such as labor shortage, low productivity, rising costs, and compliance issues, Samenta aims to combat dishonesty and deceit in business practices, promoting genuine sustainability efforts.
