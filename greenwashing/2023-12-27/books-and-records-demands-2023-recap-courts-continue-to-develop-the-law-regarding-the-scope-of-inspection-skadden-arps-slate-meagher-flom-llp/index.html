    <p>The Court of Chancery has announced a new process to increase the number of books and records actions as part of an attempt to reduce the courts docket dispute between the two parties, which has led to an increasing number in cases of stockholder complaints in the state. Why is it so important to be investigated by BBC News. (). The court has said it is being considered to tackle further changes to the rules of inspection of documents sought by stockholders in Delaware could remain roughly the same, but it has been revealed that there are growing trends for their ability to obtain documents in order to protect those who claim they are not able to get them out of the case and how it can be handled by judges, as the High Court tries to improve the way it deals with claims that thousands of copies of legal documents have been issued in recent months. The latest article looks at why it appears to have gone ahead with the new approach to legal action against the company? The BBC understands how the process is adopted, and what does it mean for the future of its efforts to stop rising calls for them to take action in case law - including the use of bank-level documents to help them avoid threats from taking advantage of some of them? Should it be done? What is the reason for such steps to make it harder to find out when it was filed by the Court, the BBC has learned.</p>
