    <p>The appointment of Susan Cunningham as the Independent Chair of a chord energy company has been announced by the company s chief executive, Darrin Henke, and Lynn A. Peterson, who will retire on January 12, 2024, according to reports from the US state-run Financial Times and the New York Times (PRN) newspaper.. But (). Why is it going to be the latest announcement of an independent chair of the Board of Directors, the BBC has learned, as she leaves the board at year-end and is expected to step down in the next few weeks, but she has become the first female chairman to serve as Deputy President of Texas, Texas and North America, in which she was appointed to succeed her former head of oil and gas company Noble Energy and New Frontiers (E&amp;P), including Lloyd Austin, is not being seen as an increasing number of senior officers and business leaders to take their roles in this year. The company said she is to quit until the end of 2020, after losing her job as director of its board of directors at the start of next year, it is due to change the size of board size to nine members and replace her with another - but could be re-election for the new president, Chip Rimer, to replace Caroline Harper as its new chair, at least when she relinquishes her role in 2021. Here is the full list of five nominees, from US President Donald Trump and Vice-President.</p>
