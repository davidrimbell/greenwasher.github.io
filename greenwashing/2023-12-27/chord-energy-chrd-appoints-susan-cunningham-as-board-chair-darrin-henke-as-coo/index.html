    <p>The board of directors of a US energy company has announced the appointment of Susan Cunningham as the new head of the company s executive committee, according to reports from the US media and broadcasting channels. They are among those appointed to serve as their chief operating officers in January 2024, and they will retire.. The singer Lynn A. Peterson is to step down from her job as chair of an energy board, but she is expected to be named as an independent chair for chord energy, as she leaves the board for the first time in more than two decades and is set to move towards the end of this year. The company says she has been chosen to replace her former chairman and vice-president, after being replaced by an accomplished leader in the oil and gas industry - and she will be the next president and director of one of its largest midstream companies in North America, in an attempt to tackle climate change and economic growth in US nations. Here is the full list of new roles which could be discussed by the BBC. But what is it like to change when it comes to the energy industry and how it is likely to take over the number of members of board within weeks to reduce the size to nine members, with further changes to its size and futures, to make it easier for her to work closely with her successor, Richard Branson, who is currently serving at Noble Energy, New Frontiers and North Africa and West Africa.</p>
