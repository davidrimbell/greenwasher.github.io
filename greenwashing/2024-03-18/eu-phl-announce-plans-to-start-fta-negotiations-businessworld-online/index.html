    <p>The European Union and the Philippines have agreed to start formal negotiations for a free trade agreement, the EU has said, ahead of the first round of talks in Brussels on Tuesday. Both sides have said they are ready to take trade relations to the next level within the coming decade, and their efforts to increase bilateral trade in goods and services. () But The Philippines has announced that the two parties have reached an unprecedented deal to boost trade and investment in the region of South Asia, as the country looks set to expand its trade relationship with the European economy in 2022, but it is not expected to be able to make it easier for them to move towards higher levels of economic growth, trade, investment and economic reforms.
