  <meta name="description" content=" The Brahma Mantra for mankind, as articulated by R Gopalakrishnan, emphasizes the crucial role of leaders with humane, compassionate, and no-nonsense thinking in ensuring the prevalence of natural intelligence over artificial intelligence (AI). Gopalakrishnan, despite his initial reservations about speaking at a tech-focused conference, found value in his perspective as a user and business leader. His insights were shaped by discussions with experts like Mo Gawdat and Ali Zubayd, and a deep dive into the subject matter.  Gopalakrishnan highlights the political and social implications of technology, arguing that AI cannot be left solely to tech experts. He stresses the importance of natural intelligence, humanism, and compassion in overseeing technological advancements. He warns against being overwhelmed by the hype surrounding AI and its potential to disrupt human intelligence.  Drawing from historical events, such as Stanislav Petrov s decision to question the authenticity of a false alarm during the Cold War, Gopalakrishnan underscores the significance of human judgment and natural intelligence. He suggests that consciousness, a state rarely explored by most people, holds the key to humanity s survival in the face of AI s advancements.  In conclusion, Gopalakrishnan s Brahma Mantra for mankind calls for a globalization of humanism and compassion, urging leaders to prioritize humane and compassionate thinking in the face of rapid technological progress. He emphasizes the need for a balanced approach, where natural intelligence and human judgment work hand in hand to guide the development and application of AI. &lt;|end|&gt;"/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://green-washer.com/greenwashing/2024-10-07/ai-cant-be-left-to-techies-northlines/">
