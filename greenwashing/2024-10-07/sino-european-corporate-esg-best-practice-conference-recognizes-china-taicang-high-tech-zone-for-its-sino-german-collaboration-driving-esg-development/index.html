  <meta name="description" content=" The Frankfurt-based Sino-European Corporate ESG Best Practices Conference recently honored Taicang High-Tech Industrial Development Zone (THIDZ) in Jiangsu Province, China, as the  Best ESG Community in Sino-European Economic and Trade Cooperation.  THIDZ, established in 1993, has been a pioneer in promoting sustainable development, corporate social responsibility, and governance within the park. Over the past 28 years, it has fostered a unique model of Sino-German corporate collaboration, focusing on key components for new energy vehicles, machine tools, and aerospace industries.  The zone has successfully attracted over 500 German companies, with total investments surpassing USD 6 billion, generating an annual industrial output of more than RMB 60 billion. THIDZ emphasizes green technology and environmental protection, as demonstrated by the Sino-German Energy Efficiency Network project launched in June 2021, which has significantly improved energy efficiency and reduced carbon emissions. The zone is now planning to establish a carbon emissions monitoring system to further enhance energy conservation and emission reduction efforts.  In addition to fostering innovation, THIDZ has made significant strides in vocational education. The first Sino-German dual education and training project was signed in 2001, marking the beginning of localized implementation of Germany s dual vocational education system. After more than 20 years of continuous effort, this system has become a hallmark of the zone s industrial development and talent cultivation.  THIDZ has also continuously improved its business environment, elevating corporate governance standards. The zone has introduced various policies to support enterprise development, prioritizing services for enterprises. The jury of the Sino-European Corporate ESG Best Practices Conference praised THIDZ as a model community for Sino-German cooperation, highlighting its success in industrial collaboration, talent development, cultural integration, and green growth.
