  <meta name="description" content=" The main conclusion from the article is that unethical practices and poor corporate governance are key factors hindering Zimbabwe s development. The inaugural ESG &amp; Sustainability Conference in Nyanga highlighted the need for improved ethical behavior within organizations to drive sustainable development.  William Mandisodza, CEO of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Zimbabwe (Icaz), stressed the importance of leaders modeling ethical conduct to foster a culture of compliance and sustainable development. He warned that unethical behavior at the top level, such as fraudulent expense claims, can lead to a culture of non-compliance among employees.  The Institute of Directors Zimbabwe (IoDZ) emphasized the role of ethical leadership in cultivating a culture of accountability and retention among employees. They criticized leaders for exploiting resources while neglecting local communities and called for the application of ESG principles in resource management and infrastructure development.  The conference participants committed to promoting ethical practices within organizations to reshape Zimbabwe s corporate landscape and contribute to the nation s development. The call for responsible resource management and infrastructure development was highlighted, with a comparison to Australia s concession requirements, emphasizing the need for change in Zimbabwe s lithium mines.  In summary, the article underscores the urgent need for ethical leadership and corporate governance in Zimbabwe to drive sustainable development and address the exploitation of resources and neglect of local communities. The conference participants pledged to promote ethical practices within organizations to reshape the nation s corporate landscape and contribute to its development. &lt;|end|&gt;"/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://green-washer.com/greenwashing/2024-10-07/unethical-practices-stall-zimbabwe-development/">
