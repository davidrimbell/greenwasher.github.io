  <meta name="description" content=" Experian s Smart Money debit card, marketed as a way to  build credit without the debt,  raises questions about its true value and purpose. While the card itself doesn t offer unique credit-boosting features, it s closely tied to Experian s Boost service, which aims to help individuals with limited or poor credit histories improve their scores. Boost scans debit card transactions for regular bill payments, potentially demonstrating financial responsibility to future lenders. However, the effectiveness of Boost is limited, with only 13 points of average increase in FICO scores for those who see an improvement.  Despite its potential benefits, Boost may not be useful for many of the 15 million users who have enrolled, as they may not experience significant credit score improvements. Moreover, Experian s business model involves selling consumer data to lenders, which can be seen as a trade-off for the free services offered.  In summary, while Experian s Smart Money debit card and Boost service may seem like a solution for building credit without debt, their actual impact on credit scores is limited. Additionally, the company s data-selling practices raise concerns about the true value of the free services provided. Consumers should carefully consider the potential benefits and drawbacks before enrolling in these offerings. &lt;|end|&gt;"/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://green-washer.com/greenwashing/2024-10-07/experian-wants-you-to-carry-its-debit-card-around-be-wary/">
