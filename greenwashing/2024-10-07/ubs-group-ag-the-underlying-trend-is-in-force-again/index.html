  <meta name="description" content=" The editorial team s analysis of the company, based on its Refinitiv ESG score and financial performance, reveals a mixed outlook. The company boasts high margins and profits, with analysts frequently revising upward their earnings per share (EPS) estimates. It has a history of releasing positive results with significant surprise rates. However, there are concerns about the company s future growth, as sales are expected to remain sluggish, and the anticipated EPS growth for the upcoming years is notably weak.
