  <meta name="description" content=" Ittihad International Investment, a diversified investment conglomerate, has achieved a provisional  AAA  ESG rating from MSCI, positioning it among the most sustainable industrial conglomerates globally. The company s portfolio spans four key verticals: Consumer Goods Manufacturing, Infrastructure and Building Materials Manufacturing, Business Services, and Healthcare Services. This top-tier rating places Ittihad among the top five industrial conglomerates in the MSCI All Country World Index (ACWI), highlighting its status as one of the highest-ranked UAE-based industrial groups in 2024.  The company s commitment to sustainability is evident in its focused approach to managing ESG-related risks and opportunities at all business levels. CEO Amer Kakish emphasizes the significance of this achievement, aligning operations with local and global efforts to drive environmental and social progress while creating sustainable value for stakeholders.  Ittihad s growth strategy is in line with the UAE s  Operation 300bn  initiatives, aimed at advancing the industrial sector and diversifying the national economy. The company generates 4% of the UAE s non-oil manufacturing sector exports, supplying products and services to over 50 countries globally.  Qais Saif, ESG and Sustainability Director at Ittihad, attributes the achievement to the company s dedication to advancing ESG practices and governance. The company has embedded ESG principles across its operations, fostering a cohesive approach across all subsidiaries. By harnessing cutting-edge technologies and investing in its people, Ittihad is committed to driving sustainable growth and making a meaningful impact.  The  AAA  ESG rating is the result of an intensive process involving the development and implementation of a comprehensive ESG Framework and the publication of the Company s inaugural Sustainability Report for the year 2023. This milestone marks a significant step in Ittihad s sustainable journey, providing a platform for further growth in the coming years.
