  <meta name="description" content=" The main conclusion from the article is that the controversy over whether a two-year-old beaver named Nibi should remain with her rescuers or be released into the wild has led to the issuance of a permit by the state of Massachusetts, allowing her to stay at Newhouse Wildlife Rescue as an educational animal. The article also highlights various climate and environmental news, including U.S. politics, tree planting, energy, conservation, and deeper dives into topics like Alberta s feral horses and salmon farming in B.C.  The article begins by inviting readers to sign up for Globe Climate, a newsletter focused on climate change, environment, and resources in Canada. The controversy surrounding Nibi, the two-year-old beaver, is introduced, with the governor of Massachusetts stepping in to protect her. The rescuers  desire to keep Nibi with them is supported by her social media popularity and an online petition.  The article then shifts to other news, covering topics like U.S. politics and natural disasters, tree planting, Alberta s oil sands companies, beluga whale conservation, Halifax s climate property tax, and salmon farming in B.C.  In the section on Alberta s feral horses, the article delves into the history of protests against the government-sanctioned cull of these animals, led by Darrell Glover. The article emphasizes the ongoing struggle to protect the horses, which are not legally protected like other wild herds in Canada. The government s argument that the horses are damaging pastureland and contributing to ecological decline is countered by Glover, who points to other animals and campers as the real culprits.  The article concludes with a call to action for readers to sign up for Globe Climate and to share their thoughts on the newsletter. It also provides contact information for readers to send their questions or recommendations.  In summary, the article discusses the controversy surrounding Nibi, the beaver, and her future, while also providing updates on various climate and environmental issues.
