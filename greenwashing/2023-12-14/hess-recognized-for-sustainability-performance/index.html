    <p>A North American oil and gas company has been named as the world s most sustainable companies. Environmental, social and corporate governance are among those listed on the Dow Jones Ssustainability Index and North America Index, according to a new report by Newsweek &amp; Stata. The latest annual ranking is being released. Here is the full list of the leading companies,.  The US economy is at risk of climate change and its impact on communities it takes to be able to tackle environmental threats and risks in transitioning to low carbon society and supporting efforts to reduce emissions and protect businesses from the impacts they carry on, and it has become the first US company to achieve the top level of its sustainability assessments for the past five years, but why is it so important to keep the country behind the global warming crisis and how it is affected by the coronavirus pandemic, the BBC has learned about the results of this years leadership - and what does it mean for their ability to cope with the effects of greenhouse gases, energy and energy policies. But what are the key figures on how the company looks at the progress of more than 1,000 public companies in the US and the future of US companies taking part in an effort to combat Climate Change? Why is this one of them? The BBC understands what happens to the companies that contributed to an economic growth strategy? A third consecutive year when it comes into the industry? What could it be done?</p>
