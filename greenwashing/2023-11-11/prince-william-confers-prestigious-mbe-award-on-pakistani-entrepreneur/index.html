    <p>The Duke of Cambridge has awarded a prestigious MBE award for his role in Pakistan s climate and sustainable transitions, according to reports from the British Crown Estate newspaper (Pkt) on Saturday, 11 November 2023, BBC News Arabic looks back at the moments in which the award was given to the Pakistani businessman Faraz Khan. But What is it likely to be one of the UKs most important achievements of his career in the world of greenhouse gases, energy and environment, and his contribution to UK environmental policies, has been revealed by the Prince of Wales on Twitter on the day he becomes the first person to receive an honorary knighthood for being appointed as the most successful persons to achieve the status of Pakistan in UK relations with the United Kingdom. Here is the full list of those who have received this award. Why is this one really going to happen? - The UK has announced it is giving their highest honour to Pakistan, who has won the title. The BBC has learned about why he is awarding another award to his Pakistan-based chief executive of an investment firm that aims to change the way the country makes its economy, environment and investment in global warming and the future of its environments. This is what happened to him? And what does it mean for an enthusiastic political leadership in his work with Pakistan and Pakistan? What would it be when he was recognised by Prince William to help promote his relationship with Britain? and who is he?</p>
