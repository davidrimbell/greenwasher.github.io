  <meta name="description" content="The energy industry has a big problem - how to deal with things like climate change, making things less carbon-based, and making sure we have enough energy. Companies in this industry have rules they have to follow, which can help them figure out what to do. But we have to be careful because some companies pretend to care about the environment when they really don&rsquo;t.
This trick, called greenwashing, is a big problem. Companies lie and use fancy words to make it seem like they are doing good things for the environment. But really, they are just pretending. It&rsquo;s important for us to know about this trick so we can make smart choices.
In the field of Production and Operations Management, people are starting to care more about being sustainable. In 2023, there will be a conference where experts will talk about how to make things in a way that helps the environment. This conference will help people work together and make good changes.
While rules and conferences are important, we can also do small things in our daily lives to help. Buying things that are good for the environment and using public transportation are examples. Technology and how we use energy is also something to pay attention to, because it can help us make better choices.
It&rsquo;s important to be careful of greenwashing and get help from experts when it comes to making good choices. PwC can help businesses with this. By being informed and aware, we can avoid being tricked and make the world better for the next generation.
In conclusion, the energy industry has problems with the environment, and we have to watch out for companies that lie about caring. The 2023 POMS India Chapter Conference wants to make the field of Production and Operations Management more sustainable. We can also make a difference by doing small things in our daily lives. By being informed and getting help, we can avoid falling for lies and make the world better.
