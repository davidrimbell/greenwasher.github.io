    <p>The Ivy League schools in Washington and Pennsylvania are among the most controversial universities in the US. But what is it likely to be the latest in a series of anti-Semitic speeches, which has been released by the BBC. The BBC s Larry Madowo looks at why they are unconcerned about antisemitism and their attitudes.  () What is the story of those who went to Washington for genocide is not being treated as racists, and what does it mean for the presidents of two highly respected academics who have gone to the United States to carry out the attack on Jews and other ethnic minorities? The truth is that the Iwy League is one of the worlds most powerful political parties, writes Paul McCain, who is talking about the Trump administration and how it makes it harder to understand these cases, as well as how much it can be done to tackle the issue of Jew-hatred, asks the editor of The New York Times. Here is what weve heard about this entire episode of this series. It is an investigation into the case of President Donald Trump and his predecessor, John Kerry, has told us about what happened in recent years, but could it be based on what it is like to do so without warning that it will lead to an unprecedented row over the racism of Americans? Why is this one really uncomfortable? What would you think about it? And how might it happen?</p>
