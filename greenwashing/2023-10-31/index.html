  <meta name="description" content="Touax Rail, a part of the Touax Group, got €40 million to support eco-friendly transportation. This shows that more companies are focusing on the environment, society, and good governance. Most of the Touax Group&rsquo;s money now comes from eco-friendly sources, meaning they care a lot about sustainability.
Air New Zealand is also trying to be more sustainable by getting rid of disposable cups in their lounges. They want to use reusable cups instead and are asking passengers to bring their own cups for tea or coffee on the plane. This will stop one million disposable cups from going to the landfill each year and shows that the airline wants to create less waste.
In Canada, the real estate industry is trying to be more sustainable to help the country become a net-zero economy. Companies in this industry are focusing on leadership and good governance to follow the eco-friendly standards. Investors are also thinking about eco-friendly things when they decide where to put their money. They use things like GRESB to see how well a company is doing with eco-friendly things. Laws at the city, province, and country levels are also making the real estate industry think more about eco-friendly things.
Ardshinbank has been given two awards from Euromoney for being good with sustainable development. They got &ldquo;Best Corporate Bank&rdquo; and &ldquo;Best Bank for ESG.&rdquo; The bank has put money into things like solar power stations and is also doing things to help the community. These awards show that people trust Ardshinbank to care about the environment, society, and good governance.
But not all industries are changing with the times. Fitch Ratings says that the fossil fuel industry might get lower credit ratings if they don&rsquo;t start using cleaner energy. Over a fifth of big companies in the world, including half of the oil and gas companies, could get lower ratings because of the risks from climate change. The International Energy Agency says that the world will use the most oil this decade, so oil companies need to start using cleaner energy faster.
In the end, more and more businesses are trying to be sustainable and follow eco-friendly standards. Companies like Touax Rail, Air New Zealand, and Ardshinbank are leading the way with their green initiatives. But the fossil fuel industry needs to change too so they don&rsquo;t get lower credit ratings and can help make the world cleaner. As consumers, investors, and citizens, we have the power to support and ask for sustainable practices so we can make the world better for the next generations.
