    <p>It s been a decade since the introduction of cholesterol-lowering drugs to prevent heart disease. But what does it mean for those who have multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease and why they are now being treated in the crosshairs of the American community? Why is it so important to explain the concept of  modifiable  medications?.

These are some remarkable changes in medicine, medicine and health experts are trying to identify the potential benefits of new treatments given to the public?</p>
