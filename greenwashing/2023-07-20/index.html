  <meta name="description" content="Environmental charity Open Seas has accused the Scottish government of failing to prioritize marine protection. The charity claims that commitments made in the Bute House Agreement (BHA) between the Scottish National Party (SNP) and the Greens have not been fulfilled, including the establishment of Highly Protected Marine Areas (HPMAs) and the protection of priority marine features. Open Seas also called for urgent action on an &ldquo;inshore cap&rdquo; to restrict fishing activity that damages the seafloor. The charity recently took the government to court over sea fishing licenses, with judges ruling the current approach to licensing was &ldquo;unlawful&rdquo;.
Wastequip, one of the largest waste equipment manufacturers in North America, has released its first-ever sustainability report, highlighting progress on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) measures. The company has been focused on reducing its carbon footprint, improving safety, diversity, and governance through its corporate responsibility program. Initiatives include reducing virgin resin used in cart manufacturing, bringing more women into manufacturing positions, and implementing dashboards for emissions and safety data. Wastequip has also developed a 100% recycled content cart with a lower carbon footprint and implemented a cart buyback program. The company has achieved gender pay equity and has seen improvements in safety incident rates. Wastequip has tied metrics to business operations, including capital expenditure proposals and executive compensation.
BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is attempting to rebrand his controversial Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investing strategies, according to Vident Financial Chief Economist Jerry Bowyer. Bowyer criticized Fink for shifting the focus away from fiduciary responsibility and towards social goals, leading to backlash. Fink has recently expressed embarrassment over the ESG debate and has referred to his strategies as &ldquo;conscientious capitalism.&rdquo; Additionally, BlackRock&rsquo;s decision to add the CEO of Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s national oil company to their board has raised concerns about their ESG image. Several states have divested or moved to divest their pension funds from BlackRock, and the company has experienced significant financial losses.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has allowed mutual funds to introduce five new categories under the ESG (environmental, social, and governance) scheme. These categories include exclusions, integration, best-in-class and positive screening, impact investing, and sustainable objectives. Previously, mutual funds could only launch one ESG scheme under the thematic category of equity schemes. Sebi has also put in place a disclosure framework for these new categories to facilitate green financing and mitigate greenwashing. Additionally, Sebi has mandated ESG schemes to invest at least 65% of assets under management in listed entities with BRSR Core assurance. These measures will be effective immediately.
Alison Jones, Senior Vice President of Global Circular Economy at Stellantis, will be speaking at the MEMA Sustainability Summit on August 15, 2023. She will discuss how the circular economy is a key part of Stellantis&#39; Dare Forward 2030 strategy, which aims to achieve carbon net zero by 2038. Jones will highlight Stellantis&#39; SUSTAINera label, which offers sustainable and transparent products and services. She will also discuss Stellantis&#39; &ldquo;4R&rdquo; strategy: Reman, Repair, Reuse, and Recycle. The conference will bring together industry leaders, sustainability professionals, and government experts to discuss various sustainability topics.
The Delaware Chancery Court has ruled in favor of Disney officers and directors in a stockholder action seeking books and records based on an alleged breach of fiduciary duty. The court determined that Disney&rsquo;s decision to publicly oppose a bill limiting instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity in Florida classrooms did not constitute a breach of fiduciary duty. The court found that deciding whether or not to speak publicly on policy issues is an ordinary business decision and that the board has significant discretion in guiding corporate strategy. The court also noted that a board&rsquo;s consideration of employee concerns is not at the expense of stockholders and can be related to building long-term value.
In today&rsquo;s news, we see a mix of positive progress and ongoing challenges in the fight against greenwashing and the promotion of sustainability.
First, environmental charity Open Seas has accused the Scottish government of failing to prioritize marine protection. Despite commitments made in the Bute House Agreement, including the establishment of Highly Protected Marine Areas and the protection of priority marine features, Open Seas claims that these promises have not been fulfilled. The charity is also calling for action to restrict fishing activity that damages the seafloor. This highlights the ongoing challenge of ensuring that environmental commitments are followed through with concrete actions.
On a more positive note, waste equipment manufacturer Wastequip has released its first-ever sustainability report, showcasing its progress on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) measures. The company has focused on reducing its carbon footprint, improving safety, diversity, and governance through its corporate responsibility program. Wastequip has implemented initiatives such as reducing virgin resin used in cart manufacturing, bringing more women into manufacturing positions, and implementing dashboards for emissions and safety data. These efforts demonstrate the company&rsquo;s commitment to sustainability and responsible business practices.
However, there are still concerns about greenwashing and the credibility of ESG investing strategies. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is attempting to rebrand his controversial ESG strategies, referring to them as &ldquo;conscientious capitalism.&rdquo; This comes after criticism that Fink has shifted the focus away from fiduciary responsibility and towards social goals. BlackRock&rsquo;s decision to add the CEO of Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s national oil company to their board has also raised concerns about their ESG image. Several states have divested or moved to divest their pension funds from BlackRock, highlighting the need for transparency and accountability in ESG investing.
In India, the Securities and Exchange Board has taken steps to mitigate greenwashing by allowing mutual funds to introduce new categories under the ESG scheme. These categories include exclusions, integration, best-in-class and positive screening, impact investing, and sustainable objectives. This move aims to facilitate green financing and ensure that ESG investments are aligned with sustainable goals. It is an important step towards preventing deceptive practices and promoting genuine sustainability efforts.
Lastly, Alison Jones, Senior Vice President of Global Circular Economy at Stellantis, will be speaking at the MEMA Sustainability Summit. She will discuss Stellantis&#39; Dare Forward 2030 strategy, which aims to achieve carbon net zero by 2038. Jones will highlight Stellantis&#39; SUSTAINera label, offering sustainable and transparent products and services. This conference brings together industry leaders, sustainability professionals, and government experts to discuss various sustainability topics, fostering collaboration and knowledge-sharing.
In conclusion, while progress is being made in the fight against greenwashing and the promotion of sustainability, challenges and concerns remain. It is crucial for businesses, governments, and individuals to prioritize genuine environmental efforts and hold accountable those who engage in deceptive practices. By staying informed and supporting transparent and responsible initiatives, we can work towards a more sustainable future for ourselves and future generations.
