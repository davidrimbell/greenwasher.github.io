    <p>Almost a third of business leaders in the Middle East and Eastern region have said they are increasingly focusing on carbon emissions reductions. But what does it mean for them to buy goods and services from the right suppliers, according to the latest analysis of the BBC s Sustainable Procurement Practice Lead (EFujitsu) report. Why is it important?  () How is sustainability really important for their organisations? Should supply chains be sustainable? And why is the impact of environmental guidance on procurement departments shifting to avoid climate change? The BBC looks at how it is likely to take steps to tackle the risks of greenhouse gas emissions and carbon management - and how could it be done to reduce the number of carbon pollution levels in developing countries such as Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the Gulf region of West Africa ( UAE ), which includes Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and Jordan? What are the key takeaways from those who buy these products? How do you buy them? Is it essential to meet  net zero ? BBC News Arabic has been asked to find out what is happening in this region, and what are its priorities for the region? Here are some of them explaining the differences in how to deal with the global economy and its impacts on the environment, as well as making improvements to make saving money? Among the most significant changes in business leadership? and who should buy it from companies?</p>
