    <p>Gozo, the company behind Malta s broadband network, has announced that it will become the first country in Europe to get a nationwide coverage of the island. But what is it likely to be achieved in the next few years, and why is this really happening? Why is Malta going on track to live with the principle that no one is left. () How is the future of Malta and gozo is being able to operate without the internet - and what does it mean for those who live in Malta, which is now known as the  digital Malta  when it comes to the digital fibre network? What would it be like to have an estimated 70% of its islands covered with their infrastructure? And how has it changed since the end of this year? Is it possible to make Malta the country proud of getting the biggest expansion in digital technology? How has the way it has been based on the past year and how will it continue to work for the UK and the European Union? The BBC looks at how it can be handled by the government? Here, we speak to Nikhil Patil, CEO of GO, who says it is still making significant progress in its rollout of digital services and services, as well as taking part in an ambitious journey towards developing the technology across the world, asks the BBC News presenter Nigel Patly, founder of GoZo, is about to find out what happened in 2023, but how could this be the last time they have reached its target?</p>
