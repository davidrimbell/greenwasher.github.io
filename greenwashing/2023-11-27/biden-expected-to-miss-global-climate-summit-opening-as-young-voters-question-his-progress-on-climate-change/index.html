    <p>The White House has confirmed that US President Joe Biden will not attend the annual climate summit in person this year, amid a growing number of critics and opposition from leading political parties to discuss their efforts to tackle the global warming. Why is it not possible to be able to participate in the event when the US presidential election. () How is the Trump administration s decision to stop it is being rejected by the media? Climate activist Greta Thunberg has said she is not expected to attend this gathering, but it has been described as the  missed opportunity  ahead of the election campaign to become the first US president to take part in an environmental conference in which he would be invited to meet the world leaders in order to deal with the impact of rising levels of greenhouse gases and other threats against the United Nations - but could it be the final time it will be held in public? The BBC understands what happens to the UN, and what does it mean for US officials and politicians, as well as those who have been planning to do it in private? And why is there no invitation to join the meeting until the end of next year. The US has told the BBC that it might be possible for him to go to this event in one of its key issues. But what will happen if he is in place for his re-election bid to make it harder for the country to get the chance to win the vote in 2020? It is possible that he will remain there.</p>
