    <p>When a family has built an immense fortune, it is hard to think about how to increase their wealth. But what do they want to do next? The BBC s weekly The Boss series profiles some of the key questions being asked by the BBCs Victoria Derbyshire businessman, Richard Branson, about the challenges of increasing. But  What is it really important, and why are those who have created successful businesses and business empires in the UK and the world - and what are the reasons for which millions of people are now struggling to find out what to invest in each other, as well as where to spend hundreds of million dollars in every decade. Why is the idea of how much money it can be spent on growing generations of family members and how can the family become rich and meaningful life? What do you want from your financial resources? Should you spend more money in creating an extraordinary family? How do we get to help them get the chance to achieve these goals? And what does it mean for the future, according to BBC Newsnight, BBC Future looks at the way the families are trying to get themselves out of this question when it comes to the business and social benefits of life, how might it be likely to be the most important question to answer the question of what is going to happen? Is it possible to make it more easier for them to gain enough funds to boost the lives of your family, writes David Robson.</p>
