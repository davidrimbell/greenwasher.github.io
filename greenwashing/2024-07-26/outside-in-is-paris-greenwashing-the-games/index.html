    <p>This year s Olympics are taking place in Paris, but what does it mean for the world’s most sustainable athletes? What is it like for climate change and how is the sustainability of the Games? The BBC looks at some of those questions being asked in a series of TV series Outside/In, which aims to answer the questions.. But ¿ What will this really happen to us in the next few years and what is going to happen in this summer and winter - and could they be the best places to go to the top of this year? Why is this the most important political event in modern history? And why are the events coming to an enthusiastic debate about the future of global warming and the impact of greenhouse gas emissions? How would these events be able to change the way scientists take their sights on environmental issues, and who will become the biggest winners of all the sporting events in recent years, as the BBC is preparing to find out what happens in next year when it comes to carbon-neutral swimming pools, how will it be likely to take place during the summer of 2020? Here are five questions that are answered by journalists and TV presenter Felix Poon, who has been talking to BBC 100, asks BBC News viewers on the first time in more than three decades, to ask the question of how to make it more efficiently than anything else in our series, writes Chris Stoke-on-the-world.</p>
