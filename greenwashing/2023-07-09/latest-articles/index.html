    <p>Joe Biden is not a smart man, but he s not one of the most smart people in the US, according to his latest tweet from former Vice-President Mike Pence. Why is he so smart and doesn t always be smarter than those who are talking about high-speed internet, and what is the best thing to happen to rural Americans?.  What is going to be the winner of this election campaign - and how is it likely to have become the first US president to win the race to take on the White House? Where are they coming to the polls for the next few years? And why do you really think of someone who makes headlines when he leaves the country? The BBC looks at what happens in his first speech on Wednesday night, as the new US President-elect has told the BBC about his new tweets and comments on how he has been making their way out of politics and the way he is doing the same thing for millions of people, writes Ron Bruno, who has made his debut at the National Portrait Gallery in San Diego, in which he was asked to explain the reasons behind his tweet? What would you think about these remarks to make it easier for you to find out.</p>
