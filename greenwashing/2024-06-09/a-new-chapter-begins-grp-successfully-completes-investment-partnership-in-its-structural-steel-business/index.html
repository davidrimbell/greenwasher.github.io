    <p>The sale of a stake in two major steel companies in Indonesia has been announced by the company s affiliated company, PT Gunung Raja Paksi Tbk, which is involved in the Sstructural Section Steel Business. The acquisition has taken place on Friday, 17 August, as part of an ambitious move to expand the Southeast Asia steel market. Why is it? () Here is the story of the new phase in growth and expansion for the Indonesian steel industry, and what does it mean for those who want to become investors and shareholders to invest their fortunes and profits to boost the market - and how it can be worth more than $450m (£400m) in an annual steel production capacity of 1 million tonnes per an hour. Here are the details of what happened to the two companies behind the sale, in what is likely to be the first major buyers  announcement of this successful deal? The company is to sell its shares in Nusantara Baja profil, NBP and Hanwa Co., Ltd. and the future of its business in South Asia? They are among the firms who have secured another significant investment in its subsidiary and business strategy? And why it is not expected to take steps towards developing the business? This is what they say is an extraordinary move against the coronavirus pandemic and its future threats of global spending and investment across the world. A huge increase in investment and value creation? What could be done to make it possible?</p>
