    <p>Defense stocks are on a roll in the US and European allies, according to the latest figures released by the BBC s Melinda Beck. Why is it so important to invest in military spending and why does it actually be worth more than $200bn (£152m) in 2020? Should they be investing more? What is this threat?

The BBC looks at the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic and how it is affecting the global economy and its ability to maintain arms supplies and protect against rising levels of globalisation? And what is going to be the focus of their annual revenue growth? It is not always being treated as an exercise in market beating? So what are these investments?
