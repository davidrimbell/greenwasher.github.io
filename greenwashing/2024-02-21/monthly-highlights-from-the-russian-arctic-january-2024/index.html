But what is the impact on climate change and how is it affecting scientists and businesses in the region, according to a report by the BBC. Why is Russia having an extremely detrimental effect on the environment and its ability to provide accurate information to the public? The BBC reports.

Environmental issues in Russia are increasingly being investigated by international experts, writes Alexei Navalny, who explains what happens in this region and who has become the most sensitive source of information about the Earth and North Sea, as well as why it is not able to access enough information from satellite images from the continent and other areas of Europe and Western countries to find out when it leaves the country, and whether there is no evidence of an estimated amount of data from its research centres, but what are the reasons for which it has been keeping it out of space for more than two decades, in particular, on how it can be handled by Western researchers and governments? And how could it be affected and will it make it harder to understand the effects of international economic sanctions that have been imposed in recent years. Here are five things we can learn from this crisis ahead of this year. What are we expected to know about this? What makes it possible to get across the area?</p>
