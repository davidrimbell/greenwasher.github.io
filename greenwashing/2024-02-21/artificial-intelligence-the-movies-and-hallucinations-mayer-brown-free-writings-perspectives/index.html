    <p>The head of the US Treasury has told the BBC that artificial intelligence (AI) may pose a systemic risk and aggravate risks to financial stability. The BBC s weekly The Boss series profiles some of those talking about the threats posed by the AI washing, which is often referred to as the  greenwashing .  ()   Why is it possible to be able to make false claims that AI is not being used by public companies and businesses to take their own actions to protect investors and investment advisers and broker-dealers, and how they are using these technologies? What does it mean for the market? And why is the risk of an enforcement warning? The chief executive of securities and exchange commission chair Gensler, who has been speaking to the public over the past few years, asks how it is likely to have an impact on the future prospects of stock market safety and the way it can be done to stop the use of AI in the UK and other markets? Where are the companies taking advantage of such evidence? Is it really essential to do so without making mistakes? It could be the most dangerous thing that is happening when it comes with Artificial Intelligence (IA) - and what makes it harder to prevent it from spreading, writes Michael Gove, but what is there for public firms and companies that have failed to comply with regulatory rules and regulators, in particular, to use it?</p>
