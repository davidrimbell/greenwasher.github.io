    <p>The transition to a circular economy has been announced by Germany’s Plastics Center (SKR). But what is it like for the company s sustainability strategy? And how can it be reported without greenwashing? Why is the SSZ plastics centre launching two pioneering projects on the subject of climate change and sustainable reporting? What is this  Kuni. But How can the cycle of plastic waste be improved and how does it really be done to improve the quality of its products, and what needs to be achieved in the future? How could it improve its quality and quality targets and the way it can be monitored by employees in their own areas of the industry when it comes to the environment? Is it possible to make it harder for them to achieve successful improvements? The SEZ plastic company is offering two new projects to help ensure the firm maintains its environmental quality, which is not the only way to tackle these challenges? Here are some questions about how they are being asked to find out why it is so important to take steps towards making it more effective and more efficiently - and will it help them reach its target levels? and is there evidence that it has become the most important part of this project? So what are the key questions behind the new proposals for further transparency? It is hard to know how it will be effectively managed to keep it safe and properly, as well as how should it work to meet the demands of all those involved?</p>
