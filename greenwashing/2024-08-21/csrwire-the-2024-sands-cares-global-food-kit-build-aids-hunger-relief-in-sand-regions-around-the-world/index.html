    <p>Marina Bay Sands has launched its third annual food kit build in a bid to address hunger among at-risk communities in the southern Nevada city of Macau. These are the stories from the company’s corporate team, which has joined the Sands Cares programme to tackle food insecurity across the world, as well as efforts to raise awareness.

This is the story of the first gathering of thousands of staff taking part in an effort to deliver food to the Singaporean community during the Covid-19 pandemic and spreading the global food outbreak in recent weeks, and it looks like it will be one of its key priorities in helping to reduce the number of people who have died from hungry illnesses and help them cope with severe food disruption and provide emergency supplies to help local residents and other areas of disadvantaged populations in Asia and South Asia, but why is it so important for businesses to provide food for the poorest and most vulnerable people to get food from at risk households, with the aim of delivering healthy food and support for poorer people in South America and Asia.
