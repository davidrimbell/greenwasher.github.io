  <meta name="description" content=" British designer Stella McCartney expressed her concern over the  billions of birds  killed for the fashion industry during her Paris show, which she titled  It s about... time.  The event, held near the Eiffel Tower, showcased sustainable fashion pieces made from unconventional materials like lentils and mushroom leather. McCartney, daughter of ex-Beatle Paul McCartney and animal rights activist Linda McCartney, is an advisor to luxury tycoon Bernard Arnault on sustainability.  Bird motifs were prominent in her spring-summer collection, where she combined her signature business suits and jackets with delicate blouses and dresses. McCartney aimed to balance the  masculinity  of some cuts with a  lightness of touch  and  femininity in flight.  She also highlighted her use of  apple leather  made from waste in the apple industry and metallic bras shaped like birds.  The designer, a lifelong vegetarian, has long advocated for sustainability in fashion, with her brand praised for its innovation and transparency. The fashion industry, however, faces criticism for its environmental impact, with some brands accused of greenwashing.  The show was attended by Hollywood figures such as Greta Gerwig, Natalie Portman, and Hayley Williams. The event also saw protests at Hermes Paris Fashion Week, where the luxury house is known for its leather goods. Despite this, McCartney s commitment to sustainable fashion remains a significant influence in the industry."/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://green-washer.com/greenwashing/2024-09-30/billions-of-bird-killed-for-fashion-says-designer-mccartney/">
