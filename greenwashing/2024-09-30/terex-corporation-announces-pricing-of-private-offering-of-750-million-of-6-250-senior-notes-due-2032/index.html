A new term loan facility will also be established, maturing on the seventh anniversary of the Acquisition, with an anticipated total borrowing amount of up to $1,250 million.  This press release contains forward-looking statements about future events and financial performance, subject to risks and uncertainties. Terex s actual results may differ materially from these statements due to various factors, including the consummation of the Private Offering, Acquisition, and Amendment.
