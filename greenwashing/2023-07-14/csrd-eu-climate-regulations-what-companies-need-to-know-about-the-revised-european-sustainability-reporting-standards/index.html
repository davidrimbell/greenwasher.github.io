    <p>The latest draft of the EU s corporate sustainability reporting standards has been released by the Nasdaq Holdings. But what are these changes and why are they now subject to a materiality assessment, which is expected to be published before the end of 2024. What is the ESRS - and what is it going to happen to companies?. () How is this changed when the European Commission will adopt their final draft, and how does it mean for companies with fewer than 750 employees being told about the future of EU spending laws? Why are some of them already approved? What are new rules designed for the corporations to report on environmental and social issues? And what could it be done to improve transparency in the way the UK is prepared to publish the new drafts of European Spending Standards (ESRS)? How do those standards have been introduced by EU regulators, the BBC looks at what happens in this week, but what has happened for businesses to get financial and impact materialities across the world? Here is an update on how the process is under way, as well as how much of it is now taking place in Europe, how do companies can become aware of what it will happen in 2023? Is it possible?</p>
