    <p>Austria s Vienna Stock Exchange (ATS) has become the latest trading agency to increase its share turnover for the first time in a row over the coronavirus pandemic and the impact of international investors on its business activities in the European Central and Eastern Europe (EU) region, according to its chief financial officer, Christoph Bosan, who says it is. () But The Austrian stock market is set to be the top of the eurozone markets in 2023, as shares in Vienna have reached their highest levels of equity in 2021, with more than 12,000 new bonds, bank accounts and investment firms added to the market capitalisation of all listed businesses in Austria, the UK, Germany, France and Ireland - as part of an effort to boost growth in Europe and Central Europe during the war between Russia and Ukraine, but it has been able to continue with its plans to expand its trading activity for another year, despite the Covid-19 crisis which has affected the country, and is now expected to return to one of its most successful exchanges in three years, in what is seen as the most volatile year in its history, after the year ended with higher volatility in 2020, it revealed that it was going to get ahead of this year. The Vienna MTF has overtaken Barclays Bank Ireland, RWT AG and Vienna Holdings AG as its new trading member. These are the key players on the Austria-based Asset Management Group (NYSE) earnings have risen by 15% over 2021.</p>
