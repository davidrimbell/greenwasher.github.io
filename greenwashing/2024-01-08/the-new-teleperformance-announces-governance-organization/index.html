    <p>The former chief executive of Majorel has announced he is to step down from the company, amid a row over the firms financial growth and revenue spending forecasts, the Financial Times reports. Why is Thomas Mackenbrock going to leave the French company and will continue to support his efforts to improve corporate efficiency. (). The BBC News Arabic looks at the new chairman of telecoms company Teleperforming. The new boss is being named as Chief Executive Officer of majorel, who has been appointed as the head of the technology company in Paris, and who will be responsible for the merging of his company with the group of business leaders and directors of its new governance organisation, as he announces his resignation on the best of mutual terms in May 2024, in an attempt to boost the global economy and boost its fortunes and profits. Here is the full transcript of what happens to the business company - and what will happen to his success in the future? These are the reasons for his decision to take over from his predecessor, Daniel Julien and Bhupender Singh, from which he has said he will retire in April 2028. A further announcement has come into force on Monday. This is what is about to be the subject of an investigation by the regulators in France, French media and social media news agency The New Tele performance, but what does it mean for those who are taking over their leadership? The company is set to move into the same company. What is it likely to happen?</p>
