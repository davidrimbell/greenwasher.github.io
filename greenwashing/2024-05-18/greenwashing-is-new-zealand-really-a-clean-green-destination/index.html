    <p>Aotearo New Zealand is a luxury retreat, but is it as sustainable as the world thinks it is? Kate Middleton asks the BBC s weekly The Boss series about the countrys eco oasis, which has been inspired by her husband, Lorde, and his wife, Kate, who lived in the remote part of the Pacific Ocean. The BBC describes how their country has become the best place to live in this country. Why is this idyllic paradise - and why does it really be greenwashed by foreigners? Here, she explains what happens to her homeland and how it can be built up to avoid climate change and what makes it safe for those who want to stay there? This is the story of her life. Here she writes about what it has happened when it comes from the outsiders who have visited the island, in what is likely to be an eco-retreat that looks clean and green as you think, as she travelled to the region, to find out where they live and are being treated in favour of environmental sanctuary, with remarks that it wasnt as clean, green, or could it be the most healthy place in our world? When she was asked to speak to an overseas traveller who was not aware of it? What would it mean for her country to take advantage of its iconic landscapes and the impact of greenwashing the planet? The truth spread in her own words, writed by Kate.</p>
