    <p>US energy company Williams has been named one of the worlds most responsible companies in 2024, according to the latest annual US sustainability assessment. Following the year, the company has become the first US company to achieve a sustainable performance in the industry across the past four years - and the second consecutive year to receive an A- rating for the country. () What is going to be known as the US s leading energy and electricity company in 2023? The BBC has learned about the impact of renewable energy giant on climate change and other areas of its environmental leadership and its commitment to transparency and governance, as it looks set to get the top spot on the list of US companies including the Dow Jones and S&amp;P global index for their achievements and priorities, and has received an upgrade to an average of five awards. The company is now among the companies who have been awarded the best earnings for this year and will be the biggest winner in US business following the release of an award for its success in 2020, but is not the only US firm to win this award, after being chosen as another nominee for an NHS ranking for his efforts to improve emissions and carbon reductions, with the number of high levels of success and performance. Here is the full list: which companies are expected to return to its top rankings in 2021 and next year when it comes to power and energy industry, in order to make it more efficient than any other company within the UK and North America.</p>
