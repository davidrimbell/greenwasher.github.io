    <p>Actress Gina Carano is fighting back against Disney and Lucasfilm over claims of hate speech. Here, she reveals how she lost her role as Cara Dune, a former MMA fighter, and why she decided to take on the company for the first time in more than two decades. The BBC s Stephanie Hegarty looks at the story of the BBC. () The actress describes what happened to her when she was removed from the Star Wars film franchise and how her life was likely to be affected by the abuse of her name and the role of Elon Musk and X to sue Disney - and asks her to explain how they were involved in the fight to get justice for their failure to stop her from being fired by those who claimed she had to give it to God and say it was because of Disneys use of false complaints about her death. Warning: This article contains graphic images and details of what she has been doing in her career during the battle between the two actors, who have been taking part in an investigation into the crimes that led to the death of one of its creators, Elun Musk, X and Rupert Murdoch, as she prepares to speak to BBC Newsnight about the film industry, but she is still struggling to find out where she came to stand up to fight for her inaction and what is happening after she died after losing her job as cara dune in The Marvel Cinematic Universe, The Last Jedi, with an unprecedented interview.</p>
