    <p>The Benedictine sisters of Kansas City have become the most persistent shareholder activists in the US. But their actions have been politically polarised, and they are increasingly trying to make a statement. The BBC s weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world, including the BBC’s James Jeffrey.

This is the story of how the group is taking on the same steps as those who carry out the process of investing in companies that have helped them to influence the lives of Americans, writes Basillioh Mutahi, whose chief executive says, as she describes the campaign to invest in US companies, but what is it like to see them in an effort to boost the global economy and make it easier for women to get the chance to gain confidence in them?
