    <p>Saudi Arabia s largest diamond maker, Sarine, has reported a 7% increase in profits in the first six months of the year, according to the latest figures from the company. However, the losses have continued to be higher than previously forecasted, but it is now making up 15% of its revenue. The company reports. But Про (InSight) says it has seen its profit rise by 5% in H1 2024, as it slumped in annual profit growth, despite rising costs and cost-cutting measures, and its net profit rose by 6.2% to $1.05 million (£3.2 million) for the second time in three years, after the fall in sales of traditional diamonds in Israel and Syria - which has been linked to severe damage to its business, with significant cuts in its production of natural diamond, in what is believed to have been the most valuable company in history. But why is it likely to make up more than half the profit of this year because of unfair conditions in natural  diamond production and the impact of hostilities during the conflict between the Israeli military and Hamas-led Islamic State and Hezbollah threats to stop it from being able to sell rough diamond equipment, it was expected to hit expectations for another decade, thanks to an increasing cost of investment, costing millions of US dollars across the world, to help avoid further financial crises that affected its operations. Here is the full assessment.</p>
