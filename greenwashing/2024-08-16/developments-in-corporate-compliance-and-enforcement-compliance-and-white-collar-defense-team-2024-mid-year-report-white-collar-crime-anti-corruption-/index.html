    <p>The BBC s weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world.

Here are five of the most successful. But How could you stay ahead in an effort to protect you from dangerous financial crises and whether you re struggling to keep up with the coronavirus crisis, which is taking place across the country, how you are prepared to take advantage of this threat? Welcome to our annual report on corporate compliance and white collar laws and what is it like to be known as the  Black Lives Matter  - and we ve been talking about the impact of some of our key topics in these weeks. These are the key stories of how we can protect us from the dangers of Covid-19 and other serious damages that affect business safety. The latest report reveals how enforcement is affecting you, as well as why you choose to stay at risk. What is the best way you go to get ready for this year? Here is what we learned about those affected by the new executives who have gone on to do so to help you cope with changes to the business environment? What does it mean for you? And how do you get the chance to stop being able to survive without having to fight illegal abuse?</p>
