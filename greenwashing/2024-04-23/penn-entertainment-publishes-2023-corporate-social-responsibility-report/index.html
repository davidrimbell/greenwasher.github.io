    <p>A leading entertainment company has announced its annual corporate responsibility report, which highlights the achievements of the companys environmental, social, and sustainability efforts across the US. Environmental, Social and Governance (CSR) report is being published on Wednesday. The company says it has invested more than $8 million in support of local charities and local communities.  The BBC Newsnight looks at what it accomplished last year, as part of a raft of new initiatives to tackle the impact on the environment and its impacts on climate change and the future of US businesses including the United States and North America, to help those affected by the coronavirus pandemic and other threats that could cause severe damage to the Earth. Here is the full report of its 2023 Corporate Social Responsibility report revealing how it helped to make an even greater impact by giving back to local community and helping their families to reduce the effects of greenhouse gas emissions and economic development grants and investing in diverse vendors and supporting the community. But what does this mean for the firm? Why is it likely to raise the bar for its success? The latest report has been released by its director Jay Snowden, who has said it will continue to be proud of this year s business. A report detailed the extent of an increase in the number of people taking part in its workforce, with funding of $70m (40m) to save the world. This is what has happened since it launched.</p>
