    <p>A Spanish fashion retailer is planning to invest 100m (200m) in recycling initiatives, a spokesman has told the BBC, citing calls for the company to be named as the anchor investor in the investment ventures and technologies behind their environmental impacts. Why is it going ahead with plans to boost the industry?.  The BBC s Jamie Bartlett has been asked to explain why it is considering investing in new ways to tackle climate change and greenhouse gas emissions and the impact of greenwashing in its fashion industry, and what could be the biggest investment of the worlds most polluted clothes industry - including the use of fossil fuels to reduce its carbon footprint and make it more sustainable? The company says it wants an investment fund to help recycle its products and technology? Should it be invested in more than 100 billion dollars in an effort to improve its sustainability ambitions? A group of people have called for it to take part in plans that are being investigated by one of its bosses, who claimed they are not aware of it. The announcement is confidential, but it has not been confirmed, as reports revealed. It is likely to get involved.</p>
