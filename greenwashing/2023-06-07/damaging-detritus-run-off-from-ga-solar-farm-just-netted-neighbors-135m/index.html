    <p>When a couple live downstream from solar panels in their valleys, they would be able to see themselves being treated as  green  by the US state of Georgia, according to one of the most successful judges. But what happened when the couple were told to live without adequate measures for erosion and sedimentation. The BBCs Larry Butler explains how the damage caused by solar farms has been taken out of sight in the case of Lumpkin Solar - and why is it likely to be the biggest threat to the country s greenest trees? Why is the company responsible for the project designed by Silicon Valley Environmental Agency (IEA) to destroy the pollution that has thrown them into mudhole fields, and what is going to happen to them? And how does it actually be like that? What is an environmental investigation into the decision to clear them of any liability in an order to stop them from using solar-powered solar systems? The case looks like it is not always the best way to do it, but could it be cleared of all the legal action against the firm that built solar plants across the United States of America? How is this really happening for those who live upstream?</p>
