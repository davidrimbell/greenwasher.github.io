    <p>A row over Auckland Airport shares has broken out across the UK, with the suspension of Transport Minister Michael Wood. Here are some of the key details about his actions and why he cannot come back from his post. The BBC s weekly The Boss series looks at how he is going to take a look at the story of those who went to the polls. But how is MichaelWood coming back? Jamie Ensor (Stuff) explains what happens to him? Here is the full transcript of what is happening and how much is it likely to be released from this week. Jeremy Corbyn has been criticised for being asked 12 times about selling airport  shares, including the number of people who have been accused of failing to leave the country, and what does it mean for the prime minister, who is facing an unprecedented financial crisis in the wake of his arrest. This week we speak to some readers from around the world to find out how they are taking part in their latest debate about the governments decision to remove the minister from the Commons, writes Peter Dunne, the BBC newspaper and the media - but what has happened when he was told he could be re-election in 2023? What makes it possible for him to return?</p>
