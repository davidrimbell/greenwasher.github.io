    <p>The wealthiest member of the US Congress is a businessman who earns millions of dollars each year, according to the latest estimates from the National Statistics Agency (ONS). But what does it mean for his business holdings, property and other assets that make him one of Congresss most valuable members? The BBC s Tom Watson reports. But  What is it actually really worth, and why is he going to become the richest person in the Senate - and how could he be able to win the presidential elections in 2024? What makes him the most successful Republican nominee to be the next US congressman, who has earned more than $1bn (77m) in his personal finances and what is the value of his investments and assets which generate hundreds of billions in non- investment income, has been revealed by the BBC Newsnight. They are among those who have spent their fortunes on the same scale as the Trump candidate, Tim Sheehy, the first person to get the chance to run for the White House, asks Paul McCain to find out what they would have to pay for him in 2020 when he is in office? Why is his net-worth reaching $74 million annually, is that he has just started being claimed during the race to lead the party to take on political nominations for US President-elect Joe Biden, as he prepares to enter the polls this year?</p>
