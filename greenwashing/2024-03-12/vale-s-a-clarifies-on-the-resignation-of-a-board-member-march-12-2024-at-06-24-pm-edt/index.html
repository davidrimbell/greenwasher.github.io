    <p>The board of directors of Brazil s largest oil company, Vale, has clarified that its performance is rigorously in compliance with the corporate rules of the body. Following the resignation of a board member, Jos Luciano Duarte Penido, the company has announced that it will continue to carry out its actions diligently ahead of next year.. () The latest reports released by the BBC News Arabic appear to show that the firm has been resigned from the headquarters in Rio de Janeiro in March 12, 2024. The company says it has received further information about the risks and uncertainties that could lead to the future of its business, as well as forecasts about its future and growth in the world markets including the global economy and the market where it operates, and will keep the country updated on the matter as soon as possible, but does not guarantee it is effectively operating within the way it operate, in order to protect the business of an increasing amount of profits from mining and metals, trading in Brazil and Canada - but will not be able to provide their annual results when it moves towards the end of this year, after being named as the boss of his board, who is re-election to serve as its CEO. What is the reason for the decision to step down from his chief executive, Carlos Alberto de Menezes explains what is likely to be the biggest Brazilian oil firm which runs across Brazil, is not the same.</p>
