    <p>Companies that does not serve the community should lose their social licence to operate, the BBC s weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. They are among the leading companies in the UK and Canada, but they are still struggling to cope with a growing number of challenges which could cause financial disruption. But why is this really important to be known as the social license to operate, and how is it likely to have to do so without being given to the public and private stakeholders? These are some of the key questions that have been asked by Larry Fink, founder and CEO of BlackRock, who has called for an institutional investor to take the top position across its portfolio? What is the risk of failing to respond to social issues? The BBC looks at what happens to companies that are not always able to achieve successful corporate performance and what is going to happen in Silicon Valley, where the company is in danger of falling out of social mobility and the way it makes businesses - and when it is not in public? And what would it mean for those who do not have enough social powers, or having nothing to help them become increasingly affected by the coronavirus pandemic and its impact on the global economy? Here is what we learned about the future of technology. The latest headlines from the business industry. What are the reasons for companies taking these steps? How do companies do it and will damage society? This week we speak to them.</p>
