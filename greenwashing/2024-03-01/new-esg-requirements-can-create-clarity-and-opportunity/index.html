    <p>The US state of California has become the first country in the world to require businesses to disclose greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related financial risks. But what does this mean for a business that could be affected by changes such as environmental and social governance, and how might it affect your company s growth and future? Why is it so important? But How is the US government ready to explain the challenges and potentially threats to change your business and the impact of the global warming? What would it be like to make it easier for you to keep up with the new rules? And why are they increasingly likely to be able to protect your corporate strategy and finances in their latest steps? The executives are being urged to take action to tackle these restrictions, writes Michael Madden, who has been asked to tell the BBC about the potential impacts of those laws? How will it make you notice that some of your companies will be required to declare the risk of carbon dioxide and other hazards that can affect the environment and its impact on the future of our business - and what is going to happen when it comes back to the industry and make sure that it is possible to stop making it harder for them to know how to deal with changing the way the country is determined to control the effects of this crisis without having to do so while taking part in an effort to reduce the number of issues that have already reached in recent weeks?</p>
