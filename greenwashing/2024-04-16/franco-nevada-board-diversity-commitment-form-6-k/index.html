    <p>The board of directors of the Franco-Nevada Corporation has announced that it is committed to diversity and inclusion at all levels of its board and senior management niveaus. Why is this acknowledgement important and what is it likely to be the biggest challenge to the corporation s success in the US? Here is the full list of nominees and candidates.. () What is being considered for appointment/election for the Board of Directors and Senior Management positions? The BBC looks at how the company is prepared to meet those who are applying for an opportunity to select their representatives to serve as Representatives, officers or employees in which diverse backgrounds have been given the same importance as they claimed by the House of Lords in New York and Washington DC, and how it does it work? What are the priorities of this board? And why are there changes to its corporate strategy and the way it deals with the organisation? This is what makes it possible for them to improve the quality of work and work of staff and staff at the end of next year. Here are five ways to tackle the issue. The executives are considering who could be chosen to help the Corporation to achieve equal rights and integrity and improve its performance. This week, the BBC understands what it has done towards the board. Among the key areas behind this policy is: Diversity and exclusion, as well as how to make it harder and more efficiently - and who should be in place.</p>
