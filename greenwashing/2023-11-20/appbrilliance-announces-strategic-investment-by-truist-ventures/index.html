Why is it going to become the next generation of Pay-by-Bank offerings and why it is being invested in additional investors?. () The BBC s weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world, from the US to the UK, and how they are making their journey towards the future of next-generation payments, the BBC has learned about the impact of the expansion of its operating system, as the company announced it will invest more than $2.5bn (1.5b) in the money-based payment rails and the way it deals with banks and FinTech partners to help businesses and consumers in order to create innovative ways to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on the global economy, but what does it mean for those who want to invest in real-time payment services - and what is likely to be the biggest ever investment in US investments? The latest announcement has been released by the tech firm AppBrilliance, who says it has launched an investment initiative to expand operations in Texas, US and US companies.
