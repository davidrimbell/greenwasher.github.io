  <meta name="description" content="Greenwashing is when companies lie or exaggerate about how eco-friendly they are. It&rsquo;s important for people to know about greenwashing and how to spot it.
One way companies greenwash is by talking about one small thing they do that&rsquo;s good for the environment, while ignoring other bad things they do. For example, a company might say they have a new eco-friendly product, but not mention that most of their other products are harmful.
Another way is by using words that sound good, but don&rsquo;t really mean anything. They might say their products are &ldquo;green&rdquo; or &ldquo;eco-friendly&rdquo; without any proof. It&rsquo;s hard for people to know if these claims are true or not.
Companies also use pictures of nature to trick people into thinking they&rsquo;re environmentally friendly, even if they&rsquo;re not.
Some Canadian banks have been accused of greenwashing. Climate activists want to investigate if the banks are telling the truth about their environmental efforts.
People need to know about greenwashing because it can make them believe things that aren&rsquo;t true. When companies lie about being eco-friendly, it can confuse people who want to make good choices.
What people think about a company is important. If people believe a company is really trying to be green, they&rsquo;re more likely to support it. But if people find out a company has been greenwashing, they won&rsquo;t trust it anymore.
One example of how people&rsquo;s opinions can be influenced is New Jersey&rsquo;s ban on plastic bags. A study found that the ban actually made people use more plastic because they used other bags that weren&rsquo;t really plastic-free. This shows why it&rsquo;s important for people to be educated and make smart choices.
In conclusion, greenwashing is when companies lie about being eco-friendly. People need to know about greenwashing and how to spot it. People&rsquo;s opinions matter, and they should be informed to make good choices.
