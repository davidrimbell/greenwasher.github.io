    <p>Mexico s largest economy has announced plans to invest more than a billion dollars in in organic growth initiatives in excess of Ps. 237,000 million in the next five years, according to the latest financial data released by the government. The Mexican company says it is planning to return to shareholders within the period between 2023 and 2024. But () The  FemSA Forward strategy has been outlined by executives of the company, as it looks at its future capital allocation plans for the first time in nearly two decades. Here is what it expects to be revealed in its annual report on the future of its business expansion and future value creation opportunities, and how it will increase its value of capital, in order to boost its profits and investment targets. Why is it likely to generate significant changes to its economic performance and risk-reward profiles and the impact on businesses and business performance, but why it has not always been seen as an important part of their forecasts for 2028? Financial experts are looking at further information about its potential capital needs and what would it mean for it to reinvest in key business models and capabilities, with the aim of returning millions of people to pay higher than the minimum income taxes and increased revenue - which could contribute to an increasingly high level of risk and profit worth of money and investing in global corporate investments in Mexico and other areas of Mexico. What does this mean?</p>
