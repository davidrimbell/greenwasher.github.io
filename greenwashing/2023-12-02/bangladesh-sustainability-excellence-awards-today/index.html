    <p>The Daily Star is to host a keynote speech at the annual awards ceremony in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, on Saturday, 17 January. They will be announced as the first winner of the country s biggest environmental achievements award, which is expected to be held in the city this weekend. But what is it like to celebrate spending. What is there to go ahead when it comes to business sustainability, and why is the award being awarded for their outstanding contribution to social responsibility and its impact on corporate engagement? These are the key nominees for this year n award. The BBC has revealed the names of six companies and three young individuals who are among those who will take part in this event, with the launch of an award to mark the end of this week. Here are five of them going to speak to the BBC on how they will tackle the impact of sustainable growth in Bangladesh and what will happen to them on the future of its business and social impact? The announcement is due to take place on Thursday.. A third time. This is what could be the final opportunity to give away the prizes. What will the day be marked? What would be it for the world? and how will these companies be recognised in an effort to improve the environment and economic benefits of life in developing countries? And where will it be honoured - and will have the chances of becoming the next recipients? A BBC News looks at how it takes to do so during the event.</p>
