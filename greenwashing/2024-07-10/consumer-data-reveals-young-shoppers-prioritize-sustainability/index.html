    <p>Consumers are more likely to pay more for sustainable products, according to a survey from Blue Yonder, the UK’s biggest supply chain platform. However, consumers remain increasingly willing to spend more on sustainability products in the last six months of the year, it has been claimed by the latest annual survey of consumer attitudes.. But Про The BBC News went to the poll to find out what they think is going to be the most important thing in their choices to buy sustainably, and why is it really important to them?
