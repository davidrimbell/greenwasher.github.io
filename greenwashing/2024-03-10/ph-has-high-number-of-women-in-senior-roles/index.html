    <p>The percentage of women in senior management roles in the Philippines has fallen by almost half over the last two decades, according to research released by the University of Edinburgh. Why is it so important for business leaders to ensure diversity and equity is maintained within mid-market firms in their own ways, writes the BBC s Jane Corby. What does the numbers mean for those who are the most senior executives and how they are able to work with female chiefs, and what is the best way to tackle the decline of the number in business leadership - and is there enough for women to take advantage of an increasing number of senior-level positions across the world? The Philippines remains among the top places where women are more likely to be involved in high-profile careers? And why are there more opportunities for them to get the chances to achieve these targets? A study has suggested that the country has seen its highest representation in top management, but what makes it really hard to find out when it is not being treated by women during the past 20 years? Does it mean that it can be harder for the business to have equal confidence and support in some areas of business, or could it be more effectively given to the women, as well as having higher levels of gender equality and gender-based attitudes? What is that strategy? How can it help businesses to improve the quality of work and work between women and men?</p>
