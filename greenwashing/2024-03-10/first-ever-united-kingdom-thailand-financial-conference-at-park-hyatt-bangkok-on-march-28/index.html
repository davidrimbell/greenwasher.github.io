    <p>The UK and Thailand have announced plans to hold a joint financial conference this year, which is expected to take place in the capital Bangkok on 28 March, in preparation for the creation of the UKs first foreign embassy to host this summit in March. But what does it mean for those who want to know about the future of their economy?.
