    <p> Canada s oilsands industry faces pressure to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions amid new anti-greenwashing legislation. The Pathways Alliance, a consortium of six companies aiming for net-zero emissions from oilsands production, has been quiet since the federal government passed the amendment to Canada s Competition Act. Despite concerns about the new law, clean energy think tank Pembina Institute believes it shouldn t hinder the proposed $16.5-billion carbon capture and storage project.  The Pathways Alliance has submitted regulatory applications for the project but has not yet made a final investment decision. The industry group has also limited its public content following the passage of the new greenwashing rules, which require businesses to provide evidence for their environmental claims.  Pathways Alliance president Kendall Dilling stated that the group continues to work with federal and provincial governments to determine the best way to enable large investments in major projects like theirs. However, the new law has made it more challenging to publicly discuss their work due to its vagueness.  A survey by ATB Capital Markets found that 53% of oil and gas producers believe the new anti-greenwashing rules will significantly impact their environmental reporting practices. The survey also revealed a decrease in the willingness of energy companies to invest in environmental technologies based on an ESG mandate.  Dreis from Pembina Institute expressed concern over the lack of a final investment decision from the Pathways Alliance, given the oilsands industry s status as Canada s heaviest-emitting sector. He highlighted the need for more announcements regarding carbon capture projects and supported the federal government s proposed legislated cap on emissions from the oil and gas sector.  The Pathways Alliance aims to achieve a 32% reduction in emissions from 2019 levels by 2030 through its carbon capture and storage network. Dilling hopes to make a final investment decision before the end of 2025, with construction beginning in 2026.  In recent developments, Shell approved two carbon capture and storage projects for its Scotford refinery near Edmonton, and Strathcona Resources announced a partnership with the Canada Grow</p>
