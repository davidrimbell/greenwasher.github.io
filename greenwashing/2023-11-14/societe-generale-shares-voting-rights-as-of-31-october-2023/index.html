    <p>The number of voting rights in the French parliament has risen to more than 100,000, according to the latest figures released by France s National Election Petitions Commission (SNCF) on Tuesday evening. These are a summary of what is expected to be the most important political parties to vote on their constitutional laws. Here is the BBC. But Here What is it really important for those who have voted in Parliament and how they will be affected by the vote of the European Union - and what does it mean for the country when elections are held in France? They will have to choose the right to voters and who are the candidates who want to have the same votes, and which would have been elected by President Francois Hollande until the end of next year. The winners of this election could be able to win the polls in Paris, in what it is likely to take place in November 2023, the results of these announcements and whether it can be seen as the result of an election in 2021. How will the number increase to 11.5%? And how will it be used to decide who will become the first democratic candidate to get the powers to go on the referendum? The BBC looks at how shares remain worth millions of euros (1.6bn) across the world without being withdrawn from the EU. What makes it possible for France and France to make the public vote against the Paris Supreme Court, whose membership is set to begin next week.</p>
