  <meta name="description" content="UEFA and the German Football Association (DFB) have made a promise to protect human rights during UEFA EURO 2024. They want to make sure the tournament is accessible to everyone and promotes diversity and inclusion. They also want to prevent discrimination and abuse, and support freedom of speech. Everyone involved, including UEFA, the DFB, and the host cities, is committed to democracy, respect, tolerance, and human rights.
A report claims that President Joe Biden&rsquo;s push for green energy is connected to cronyism and insider dealing. The report says that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) relied on a company called Persefoni when making new rules for reporting greenhouse gas emissions. It is alleged that SEC employees who helped make the rules later got jobs at Persefoni. Critics say this is a favor to people with political connections and doesn&rsquo;t help consumers or shareholders. The SEC&rsquo;s proposed rule would make companies report their CO2 emissions and plans to reduce them. The report also raises concerns about the cost for smaller companies and the benefits for accounting firms. There are also reports of a private meeting between President Biden&rsquo;s clean energy czar and the CEO of a struggling electric vehicle company.
A new study shows that if we reduce greenhouse gas emissions, natural forests can capture a lot of carbon. The study says that about 226 gigatonnes of carbon can be captured through natural forest recovery. This means we need to take care of forests and manage them sustainably to help fight climate change and protect biodiversity. The study suggests that efforts led by communities can make a big difference. It also says that when restoring forests, we need to make sure there is a variety of species and respect the rights of local communities and Indigenous people. But forests alone can&rsquo;t solve the problem of fossil fuel emissions.
Consumer psychology is important for marketers to understand. It helps them know how consumers think and make decisions. Consumer psychology includes things like how we see things, what motivates us, our attitudes, and our emotions. By understanding consumer psychology, brands can create better marketing strategies, products, and customer experiences. Technology and social media are part of marketing, but the most important thing is understanding people and their behavior. Marketers need to keep learning about consumer psychology and technology to stay ahead in their field.
The Singapore FinTech Festival 2023 will focus on using AI in the financial sector. The festival will talk about ethical AI, data governance, cyber resilience, and financial inclusion. It&rsquo;s expected to have over 60,000 attendees from around the world. The festival will also show the Project Greenprint initiative, which wants to make the FinTech industry more transparent and sustainable. UnionBank of the Philippines will be a sponsor and show its technologies and digital transformation.
Protests have led to reduced operations at the Cobre Panama mine. The mine started in 2019 and has faced environmental and social issues. People want the mine to close and stop all future mining in Panama. The mine has had legal problems and hasn&rsquo;t been transparent in contract negotiations. This shows the importance of addressing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues in mining.
A document obtained by The Associated Press shows that an EU law aimed at reducing emissions may be weakened. The law was made to make sure companies don&rsquo;t harm the environment or human rights. But now, companies may not have to follow the goals of the Paris Agreement. This means banks and insurers could keep financing or insuring projects that cause global warming. Nonprofits are worried that companies will only have plans to reduce emissions without actually doing it.
Maple Hill Creamery is a dairy company that uses grass-fed organic farming. The founder switched from conventional farming to organic and grass-fed because organic milk sells for a higher price. The switch made the cows healthier and attracted more young farmers. But the founder is worried about the unclear definition of regenerative farming and companies pretending to be sustainable. The dairy company got $20 million to grow its sustainable farming.

This shows that it&rsquo;s important to consider ESG issues in mining.
California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed two important laws. The first law requires companies to report their greenhouse gas emissions if they make over $1 billion a year. The second law requires companies to disclose their financial risks related to climate change if they make over $500 million a year. These laws go beyond what the SEC proposed and are supported by Democrats from California. The SEC will listen to feedback before making its final rule, and there may be legal challenges to the California laws.
