    <p>Samsung Electronics has become the worlds highest-paid brand for a third year, according to the latest annual assessment of its brand value in the US and the UK, the BBC has learned. Why is the company proudly recognised for promoting consistent customer experience strategy and leading future technologies such as 6G, AI and virtual reality (VR)?.   Samsung has been named as the best Global Brands for the fourth year in an row - and what is it likely to be the biggest brand in its history, and is expected to increase by 4% across the global business areas in 2023? The BBC s Chris Stoke-Walker looks at why it has grown steadily, but does it always struggle to grow sharply, despite struggling demand in Silicon Valley and other industries? They are among those who have reached the top five brand worth? And what are the key factors that led to its growth? What is its value and how could it be able to boost the business of the technology industry? A look at how the firm has achieved this year. The company is now being given the go-ahead for its success in 2020? It is not the only company that has seen the most significant rise in sales and profits of millions of consumers in global technology markets? This is what Samsung says, as it continues to develop innovative technology, technology and technology. But it is also the first to achieve higher value than any other company in this category?</p>
