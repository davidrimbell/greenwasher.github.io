    <p>A new Guidance on Business and Human Rights for Business Lawyers has been released by the IBA Bar Association (IBA) and other leading lawyers across the world. The latest guidance is being published in English, Chinese, German, Japanese, Russian and Spanish, according to a group of expert avocats who have written their guidelines.
