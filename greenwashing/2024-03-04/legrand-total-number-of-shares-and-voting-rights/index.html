    <p>The number of voting rights to Legrand, the French electrical and digital building infrastructure company, has been revealed in the latest financial statements released by the Limoges Holdings Group (LMOGES). The total number is expected to be 262,295,930, according to a preliminary release of the company s initial shares.. () But What is it going to take on the stock market in 2024? These are the key figures for the Le Grand Group, who has announced it is to sell its share capital in Paris, and which is now listed on French stock markets - and what is the result of their annual announcement. The amount of stocks that could be withdrawn from the public remains as early as December 31, 2026. This is what does it mean for those who have voted without the right to vote on stock options and how they are taking part in its first-quarter results. Here are some details of how LeGrand is set to get the value of its stake in France, as the group announces its initial results from February 29, 2028, after the first time it was reported to share holders in March ahead of this year. A further expansion is due to begin next year, but the number has not been confirmed by investors until the end of November, 2021, to see when the firm takes another third quarter of trading, in what will be the final phase of leaving the market. What would be it? The BBC News looks at how it will take it out.</p>
