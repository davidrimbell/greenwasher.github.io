  <meta name="description" content="Greenwashing is when companies pretend to be eco-friendly when they&rsquo;re not. They do this to attract people who care about the environment. They use misleading words or images to make themselves look better than they really are.
Some common greenwashing strategies include using unclear words like &ldquo;natural&rdquo; or &ldquo;eco-friendly&rdquo; without proof, focusing on one good thing about a product while ignoring bad things, using green colors to seem sustainable without making real changes, and making big claims about how good their products are for the environment.
Companies use greenwashing in ads, labels, and marketing to trick consumers. For example, a fast fashion brand claimed to be eco-friendly but still made lots of waste and used harmful chemicals. Another company said their food was organic when only a small part of it actually was.
Consumers need to watch out for greenwashing to make smart choices and support truly sustainable companies. By spotting fake claims, consumers can push companies to be more honest and eco-friendly.
Greenwashing can mislead consumers into supporting harmful practices. For instance, a cosmetics company said they didn&rsquo;t test on animals but later it was found they did in some places. This hurt their reputation and sales. This shows why it&rsquo;s important for companies to be honest about their environmental efforts.
To sum up, consumers must be careful to spot greenwashing and back real sustainability. By demanding honesty and ethical practices, consumers can push for a greener future.
