    <p>One of the worlds most ethical companies has been named as the World s Most Ethical Companies (Woa) for 11 consecutive years, according to a report by the Financial Services Authority (EIU) in New York and Glasgow, US media reports. These are the full list of those who have been awarded this year. What is the BBC.   How is it going to be given the top honour? Why is this award really important for the company? The annual list is being published in the US and Canada, and what does it mean for their corporate leadership and business practices and how they are taking part in an effort to improve the quality of trust and integrity in financial services industry? A leading executive has announced that it has received this recognition for one of its most high-profile achievements? And why has it been recognised as an honoree? What could be the most ethical company in its history and the way it is doing the business - and who has won the award for more than 11 years and will become the first company to receive this honor in this category? How can it achieve these awards reach another level of international transparency and commitment to quality and quality? It is not the only company that has achieved the status of an award to take advantage of high levels of quality when it comes to its diversity and standards of conducting justice and governance, writes Larry Madowo, who says it cannot be seen as one worldwide.</p>
