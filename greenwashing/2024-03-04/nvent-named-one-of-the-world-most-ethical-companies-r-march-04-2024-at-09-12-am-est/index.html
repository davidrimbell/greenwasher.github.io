    <p>A US electric company has been named one of the worlds most ethical businesses, according to a leading ethics assessment framework developed by the US company EcoVadis in Silicon Valley, New York, and Ohio, US regulators have announced. n vent has received an outstanding global recognition for its commitment to business integrity.. But What is it and how is the company responsible for the achievements of employees and its corporate actions when it comes to the business of its bosses and business leaders, the BBC has learned about the impact of his efforts to improve the quality of business confidence in the UK and Europe. The BBC understands what it says is being treated as the most sustainable company in Europe and the future of global business, but why has it been awarded the top prize for breaking the standards of trust and governance across the country? Why does it behave like the best company to achieve these awards - and what makes it harder for it to be able to make it more efficiently and more effectively operating without having to do anything to protect its customers and customers? A sharply improved business practices and claiming it has become the biggest environmental and social sustainability initiatives? The company is now among the companies who have been recognised by Ethisphere, who has won the award for an international award of more than 11,000 jobs in its world-class safety and security policies? and who could be the first to receive this award, writes BBC Newsnight.</p>
