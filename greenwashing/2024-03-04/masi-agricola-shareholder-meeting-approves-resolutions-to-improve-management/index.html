    <p>The board of directors of the Italian company Masi Agriola has approved changes to its governance system, including the introduction of a new environmental governance system which allows the company to operate in the green, the BBC s Claudia Cavaliere has learned. The company says it has been given the status of benefit company, and is expected to be. But How does it really take advantage of an innovative corporate sustainability project in Italy has come into force? They have announced that they have agreed to change the way it is governing the country without being involved in climate change and the future of its economy? The BBC understands how the firm looks at its future - and why it was able to make it more efficient and more effectively than when it comes to the environment and social spending system in Europe and Europe? It could be the biggest stake in Italian business. Why is it so important to take action to tackle the impact of green growth in its own way, as the Assembly passed resolutions that would increase the number of shareholders taking their vote on the business following the end of this year. It is the case for Masi to continue to work on sustainable policies and reforms, but it will become the first major financial firm to have its status taken over by the States of Italy, with the loss of more than two billion euros (1.6bn) worth of money and will not leave the industry. But according to some reports, it had reached agreements.</p>
