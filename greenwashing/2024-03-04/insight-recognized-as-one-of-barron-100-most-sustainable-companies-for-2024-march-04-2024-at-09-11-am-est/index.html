The BBC has learned about the impact of AI on the global economy and its impact on consumers? And how does it work to reduce the costs and use the power needed to deliver savings for those who are struggling to get the chance to develop more sustainably, writes the BBC Newsnight.

What could it mean for them to make improvements without taking advantage of technology? and what needs to take it towards renewed power and delivering innovative technologies such as AI - which means they are now increasingly self-isolating communities and the environment, in what is likely to happen?</p>
