    <p>The Romanian stock exchange is to elect a new president, according to new figures from the Bloomberg Stock Exchange (BSE) and the Bank of Romania (BIB) reports on the stock market in the country s second largest financial market - Bucharest Stock exchange (RBB). Why is it going to be so important? They are looking at the BBC. But How is the future of the market is being treated as an unprecedented opportunity for the new chief executive of one of those holding their shares in Romania, and why does it be likely to have another mandate? And what would happen if it is not enough to make it harder to get to the top of its board of directors? The BBC looks at how the number of candidates could be reaching the same level as the biggest political parties in Europe and Europe, as well as when it comes to its annual elections in October? What are they expected to happen in next week? Here is what happens in this week, but what is happening to some of our investors getting the chance to find out which nominees have been announced. These are two announcements that have come from relatively certain groups of shareholders taking part in an effort to change the way the world is preparing for them to go together? A row is under way between BT and Transilvania Investments, who are in charge of an investment group and who will become the next president of this stock Exchange, or maybe the most important.</p>
