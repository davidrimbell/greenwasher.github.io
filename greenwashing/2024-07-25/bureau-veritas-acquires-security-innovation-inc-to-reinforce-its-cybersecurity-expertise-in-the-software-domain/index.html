    <p>A US-based software security firm has signed an agreement to acquire a leading technology firm in the cybersecurity sector, which is expected to increase revenue in 2024, the Financial Times has learned. The acquisition has been announced by Bureau Veritas in Paris, France, on 25 July 2028, and will generate more than 200,000 jobs. (). The BBC Newsnight looks at how the company is preparing to launch its new cyber security strategy to strengthen its expertise in computer security and testing sectors across the world, as the US announces it has agreed to buy Security Innovation Inc. to reinforce its Cybersecurity experts in its software domain, to boost the global growth in cyber-security and boost its global presence. Why is it going to be able to scale it globally - and what is the future of the technology industry when it comes to cyber Security? These are the details of what it is likely to have revealed ahead of this week s Paris announcement, but it will not be the first major investment in US technology giant behind the new venture. Here are some of those who are being given the chance to expand their efforts to revive the UK and Europe. But what does this mean for the security industry and how it can become the next phase of its business? The US government has confirmed that the firm is to take over the investment of US software firm Security innovation, who is set to create another significant expansion to the market? What would it mean? BBC Monitoring reports.</p>
