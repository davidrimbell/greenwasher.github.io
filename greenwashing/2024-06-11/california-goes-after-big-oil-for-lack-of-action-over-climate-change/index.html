    <p>The US state of California has filed a lawsuit against four major oil companies, including BP, Chevron and Shell, over their environmental marketing claims that they are less environmentally friendly than those that truly are, and which could cost the state billions of dollars in damages to climate change, the US government has said. Why is this threat? What is the BBC s Larry Madowo explains what is going to be claimed by the justice department of the California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who is suing the company to relinquish profits from fossil fuels, has been accused of misleading false advertising and potentially greenwashing by some of its chief executives and business leaders. The Supreme Court has heard that Big Oil is facing an investigation into the country’s biggest oil firms that have failed to pay to tackle the risks it has caused to save millions of people in California, to find out how much it is likely to benefit Californians in the past two years, writes The New York Times. But why are these companies behind the legal battle to stop being involved in  greenwashing  and how it does it work? Should it be prosecuted for illegally making emissions warnings about the effects of carbon warming and the impacts on the environment, asks the federal prosecutor to take action to try to make it harder to protect themselves? What would be the answer to the case? The California government says it will be forced to investigate.</p>
