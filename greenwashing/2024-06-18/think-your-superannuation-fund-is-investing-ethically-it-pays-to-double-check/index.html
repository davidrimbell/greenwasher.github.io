    <p>Australians are more likely to invest in super funds, according to a leading advisory group. Why is this increasing concern with greenwashing in their investments? Should they be told to do more to protect themselves from the abuse of those claims made by the public, the BBC has learned. But why is it so important?.

What is the best way to get these warnings to stop the decline of Greenwashing? The latest report has revealed that the number of people in Australia are now more concerned about greenwash, not just because of its attitude to greenhouse gases and other types of products that are being invested by someone who believes it is not always responsible?
