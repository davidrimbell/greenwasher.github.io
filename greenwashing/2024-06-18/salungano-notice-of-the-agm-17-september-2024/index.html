    <p>South Africa s Companies Act has approved the nomination of Mzimkulu ( Mzi) Malunga as a new director of the South African Broadcasting Corporation (JSSE) which has been appointed to 2024. The nominees have been passed by the company chairman and chief executive of Arena Holdings and the D Group, including the BBC.. () But Here is how does the board describe the past performance and performance of those retiring directors, and how they can be re-elected? These are the key questions being discussed in the House of Lords in Johannesburg on Monday, 17 January, 2018. This is the full list of non-executive Directors who are expected to be elected by their former leadership officers. Here are some of them explaining the reasons for the resignation of an independent director, who is among the five candidates who have gone on leave. It is not known to say that he is now standing for his appointment as the new Director, Mzi Malonga is to step down from his position, as it looks set to change the way the firm is conducting its annual elections in March 2026. A committee of senior judges has decided that it will appoint him to replace him as director - and he will not be the first candidate to serve as an acting director at this time. What is it likely to have to do with the decision to remove him from the office of his successor and who will be eligible for further notice. But what will happen?</p>
