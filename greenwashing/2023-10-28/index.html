  <meta name="description" content="Tyson Foods, a US food corporation, has recently invested in Protix, a provider of insect ingredients, to build a factory in the US that will produce food for pets, poultry, and fish. While Tyson officials claim that insects will not be put into human food, the press release suggests that the merger may be inspired by environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. This move raises questions about whether Tyson will expand into making food for animals or if the insect-protein facility will eventually produce ingredients for human food. It is important to be cautious and not be deceived by false advertising or misleading claims.
In an effort to address the data gaps in emerging market analysis and promote sustainable growth, the Future Investment Initiative (FII) Institute has released the &ldquo;Inclusive ESG Tool&rdquo; and &ldquo;Inclusive ESG Score&rdquo;. These tools aim to help emerging market companies and global investors unlock investments and reduce the $5.4 trillion ESG investment gap in emerging markets. This is a positive step towards fostering sustainable development and ensuring that companies prioritize environmental, social, and governance factors.
The &ldquo;For a Sustainable Future Awards 2023&rdquo; ceremony in Hungary recognized companies and individuals for their contributions to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and systemic sustainability change. The event highlighted the business risk of biodiversity loss and emphasized the need for corporate engagement in biodiversity restoration and nature-based climate solutions. The awards ceremony aimed to promote a sustainable business landscape and foster discussions on environmental conservation.
Link Group, a social enterprise group, showcased its successful Riverside Dalmarnock development in Glasgow&rsquo;s East End. The project included a mix of social rent, mid-market rent, and outright sale homes. Link secured significant funding from Bank of Scotland and Scottish Widows, becoming the first Scottish social housing provider to access an ESG-linked loan on this scale. This is a commendable effort to increase affordable housing in Scotland and contribute to sustainable development.
Sulochana Cotton Spinning Mills, based in Tamil Nadu, India, is leading the way in sustainable and circular fashion. The company buys 4,000 tonnes of used PET bottles per month and converts them into polyester fiber, yarn, cloth, and garments. They have a 150-acre facility that includes solar energy panels, bio gasifiers, and plastic-free zones. The company aims to be 100% carbon neutral by 2027 and has already achieved 94%. This is a great example of how businesses can prioritize sustainability and make a positive impact on the environment.
The 2023 UN Climate Change Conference, also known as COP28, will be held in Dubai. Developed countries are failing to meet their commitments under the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement, while seeking to pass their responsibilities onto developing economies. In contrast, India is making significant progress in combating climate change and has set robust targets for climate action. India should stand firm against the tactics of developed countries in climate change negotiations.
New research from the Australia Institute reveals that over 60% of &lsquo;No&rsquo; voters in a recent referendum are concerned about the misinformation and disinformation spread on social media during the campaign. The study also found that more than 80% of these voters want to see truth in political advertising laws implemented before the next federal election in 2025. This highlights the need for laws to protect voters from misleading and harmful electoral conduct.
It is important for consumers to be aware of greenwashing and not be deceived by false advertising or misleading claims. By staying informed and supporting companies that prioritize sustainability and environmental responsibility, we can contribute to a better and greener future for our children.
