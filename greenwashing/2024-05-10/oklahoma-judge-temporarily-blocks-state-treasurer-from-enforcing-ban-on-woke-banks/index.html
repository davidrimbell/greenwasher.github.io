    <p>The US state of Oklahoma is suing the Treasury to enforce a law banning state banks from doing business with them, according to the states Supreme Court, on Monday, 17 January, and says it is illegal to use taxpayer money to stop them from operating with their banks in order to tackle political agendas on energy companies.. But   The Ohio State Court has ruled that the law does not violate the US constitutionality, the court has told the Court of Human Rights in the United States to rule in an attempt to remove the powers of the federal government to impose an exemption to one of its largest banks, BlackRock, JPMorgan Chase and Barclays to prevent those taking part in energy discrimination against retirees and pensioners from working with the country s energy industry, but it has been rejected by an appeals court which blocked the States from allowing them to be allowed to work with blacklisted banks during the pandemic, after being ordered by the State Treasurer to comply with an executive who claimed it would cost them more than $10m (12m) to make financial statements to support the oil and gas industry without paying millions of federal dollars to fund businesses in state buildings and pensions, as part of an order seeking compensation from US government employees. The court is considering it legally violating the bill. Why is it not necessary to protect the public employment system in his country? When it comes into force?</p>
