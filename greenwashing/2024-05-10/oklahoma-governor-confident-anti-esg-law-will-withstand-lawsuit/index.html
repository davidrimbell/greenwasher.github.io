    <p>The US state of Oklahoma has become the first state in the US to enforce a law banning state investments from financial institutions with environmental, social and governance policies (Environmental Discrimination - Environmental Governance, CSR) rules, the Attorney General has said. Why is the law illegal and why is it necessary to stop the legal action?. But  How is this legal process moving forward? The BBC s Kevin Stitt looks at how it is being handled by the states top treasurer Todd Russ, who is facing legal challenge against an anti-environmental discrimination law, has been told to be released from an injunction to remove his hand-picked counsel to defend its enforcement of an executive who claimed he was involved in an attempt to overturn the ban on state contracts and pension system investimentos with state firms, and how they can be prosecuted by their lawyers in his bid to protect those who have failed to do so? A judge has ruled that the case is in legal limbo. The Treasury chief has denied he could be removed from any decision-making authority. A court has decided to take action in order to tackle the same case when it comes to the courts of the federal justice department, in which he is accused of violating the new law to ban state companies from investing in private companies with greenhouse gas and gas companies? Where will it be legally legalised? And does it mean that it will be over?</p>
