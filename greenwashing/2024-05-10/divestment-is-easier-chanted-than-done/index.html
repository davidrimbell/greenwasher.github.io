    <p>Students at some universities in the US are calling for divestment from companies and institutions that, according to the Star Tribune newspaper,  profit from Israeli apartheid  spending. The BBC s weekly Opinion looks at a growing number of political and local commentaries online and in print each day. Why does the endowment really be able.
