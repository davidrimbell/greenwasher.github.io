    <p>Former Republican presidential candidate Geeta Ramaswami has become the first person in South Carolina to announce a $500m (400m) divestment of pension monies from legacy firms like BlackRock and Strive, the US states largest investment and asset management body, according to the New York Times newspaper and the latest reports.  But Trump The BBC News and Courier has been quoted as one of the most prominent political figures in the Trump campaign to win the White House nomination for US president, writes the BBC s Vikas Pandey, who says he is trying to infiltrate an anti-environmental lobbying campaign in Missouri, and explains how he appeared to be involved in meetings with state treasurers at annual settlements for former chief financial officers and business executives, as he described their actions as being linked to his campaign against environmental surveillance and social rights activists who have called him an advocate for his efforts to influence the election campaign, saying he was taking part in an unauthorised approach to investing wealth from the state. But why is it likely to have been criticised by some of his supporters? Why did he began talking about the process?</p>
