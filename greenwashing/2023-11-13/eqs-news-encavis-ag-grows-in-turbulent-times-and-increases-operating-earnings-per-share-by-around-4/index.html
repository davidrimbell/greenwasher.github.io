    <p>A German wind and solar park operator has reported a significant increase in electricity production in the first nine months of the financial year, according to Germany s Asset Management Board (DFB). Why is it likely to be worth more than 7bn (7m) - and why does it actually generate net revenue in 2023?. But Here is the story of what happened to the energy industry in Germany. The latest figures are being published in March 2023, and what is going to happen for those who remain on their growth path? Financial forecasts for 2023 have been revealed by the management board following the restructuring of two wind farms and energy firms, as part of efforts to reduce the costs of power supply and boost the production of energy generated by renewable power and wind turbines in Europe and Europe? The company is set to raise earnings per share by around 4% during the pandemic, but it is not expected to have reached its highest level since the war in Ukraine. A further expansion has been confirmed as the company says it has grown in turbulent times and is on the track for the full year of 2023 which could be the most successful in its history, with an increasing production volume of nearly 3,000 megawatts (GBh) to near the level of its previous year when it comes to power production, the BBC has learned. These are the key factors that fuelled by new infrastructure projects and the impact of coronavirus.</p>
