  <meta name="description" content="Forests are important in fighting climate change and protecting nature, says a recent study in Nature. We need to work together to save and restore forests, as they can store a lot of carbon. But forests alone can&rsquo;t solve climate change, so we also need to reduce fossil fuel use.
At a summit in London, companies were told to take action on their promises to be sustainable by 2030. They were also warned about &ldquo;greenwashing,&rdquo; which means pretending to be sustainable when you&rsquo;re not. The summit also talked about new ways to watch TV without paying.
GreenRock Capital and Petros PACE Finance gave $62.6 million to build a fancy hotel in Sonoma County. The hotel will be sustainable and give guests a special experience. This kind of financing is becoming more common in real estate.
LOCOMEX Inc. won an award for using data to make their business better. They have made their supply chain more efficient and sustainable. Their goal is to help suppliers and reduce pollution.
In New Zealand, a group is fighting against mining on public land. This land is important for animals and New Zealand&rsquo;s environment.
These stories show how important it is to be honest and transparent about being sustainable. Greenwashing is a problem. Companies and people need to take real action to make the world greener.
