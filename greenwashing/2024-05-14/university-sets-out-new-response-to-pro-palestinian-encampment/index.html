    <p>The University of Oxford has urged students and staff to remain compassionate after a de-escalation of anti-Palestinian protests in the Gaza Strip, which led to an increase in violence between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants across the occupied West Bank, on Saturday 11 May, and the latest attacks on the Israeli military.. ().  The BBC has learned that the University is being asked to take action to tackle antisemitism, Islamophobia and unlawful discrimination at the encampment during the conflict in Gaza, as tensions continue to escalate in recent days, but says it has not committed to the right to protest while refusing to commit to several demands made by the university, who claimed they have been threatened with abuse at their members, in an email sent to all students who have received complaints from those who protested against Israel and Hamas, the BBC understands what happened to some of the protesters who disrupted an en camp where thousands of people were killed by police, police and demonstrators following the deadly attack on one of its buildings, after an attack by six men earlier this week. The university has said it does not accept any hostility or intolerance directed at its members because of an attempt to stop demonstrations that have caused unimaginable suffering in its response to this massive debate over the recent invasion of Gaza - and warned it is not going to be able to do so.</p>
