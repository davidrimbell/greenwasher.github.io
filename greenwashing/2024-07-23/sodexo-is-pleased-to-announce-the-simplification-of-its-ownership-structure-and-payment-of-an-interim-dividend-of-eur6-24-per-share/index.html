    <p>Sodexo has announced the conclusion of a share  purchase agreement with Bellon SA, which allows the company to unwind the cross-holding loop between the two holding companies, and monetize an il liquid and undervalued assets. The announcement has been approved by the board of directors of the firm s financial affairs (AMF) in 2024. But How is Sodekso to sell Sofinsod to Bellol SA and how is it worth the sale of its subsidiary to so-called  super-wealthy  group, so that it will be distributed to shareholders in the form of an interim dividend of €6.2 per share. So why is the deal going to be completed? So despite being given permission for the purchase of so many shares, it is expected to become the first major buyer in France to take advantage of this acquisition - and what does it mean for those who have taken their stake in sodomy and other firms to buy it? The BBC understands what happened when it was reported to have been unveiled by its chief executives in Paris, France and France, as well as how it deals with the French company, but how could it be used to make it more profitable and easier to use it for more than two decades, the move has triggered an unprecedented increase in its shareholdership and the value of some of his corporate accounts. But what is so far known as the  fair buying Agreement  following the transfer of cash to the business?</p>
