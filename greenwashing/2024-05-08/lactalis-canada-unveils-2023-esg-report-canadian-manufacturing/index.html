The latest report has shown that it has achieved another $2.5bn (2.1m) in its first quarter of the year, and has been awarded an award to the Royal Society of Food and Drug Administration (RSPH) award in 2023, but says it will continue to work more closely with the firm, as it prepares to announce its 2023 annual report on how it is preparing to achieve further goals and improves its success.
