    <p>Environmental risk and impact management, social responsibility and governance are among the key areas of the financial sector s corporate sustainability report, which has been released by the Bank of England (DEI) for the first time in more than a decade. Why is it so important to ensure the business remains in the same direction and where it is being. But What is the impact of climate change, and how does it affect the environment and the community of people of colour and colour - and what makes it more important for us? The BBC looks at the progress of banner bank executives and business leaders across the world. The latest report on environmental risk assessment (Environmental Responsibility) has revealed how the firm has achieved significant progress in its efforts to tackle the coronavirus pandemic and its impact on the global economy, the BBC understands how it handled the risks of carbon and greenhouse gas emissions, as well as why it has not been seen since the end of this year? Here are some of its key disclosures, in their annual report to mark the start of next year, to find out what they have taken to the top level in 2023? What are the priorities for them? These are five examples of how to improve its performance and improve the way it manages its business, writes David Robson, who explains what is likely to be the most important step towards the future of our business? And how will it be able to achieve sustainable growth and whether it can be used to protect those who have been affected?</p>
