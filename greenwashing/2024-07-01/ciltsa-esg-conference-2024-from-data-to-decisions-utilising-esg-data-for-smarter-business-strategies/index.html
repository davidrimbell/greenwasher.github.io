    <p>South Africa is hosting its third annual environmental summit in a bid to improve their economy, including the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to drive businesses into sustainable growth. Here are some of the key topics in the coming weeks. Why are these events going to be the focus of this year s Environmental Governance Conference ( SDG). () What is it likely to take place in South African cities - and why are they taking part in an event which is being held by hundreds of people across the world to find out how to get the right data for those who use the data and use it for smarter business strategy and how it can be handled by the public?

This is what it is about to do. How to navigate the complexities of its data landscape?</p>
