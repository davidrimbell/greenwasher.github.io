    <p>Plans for a new quarry in Ballyconnell have been submitted to council planners until June 5 to address environmental concerns. Here are the latest steps to tackle the risks of threatening wildlife and habitat. The BBC s David Robson looks at what could be done to protect the environment and the nature of the local authority. What is going on? Why is this proposal being asked to be given planning permission to make further submissions to locals and community groups? What does it mean for an ancient site and why is it likely to lead to an unprecedented damage to the site? How would it be affected by climate change? And what is the impact on the land and water system in the Vale of Glamorgan - and how will it affect the natural world? Here is what happens in County Tyrone, which has been described as one of Wales  largest quarrying sites, and whether it is possible to stop it spreading across the country? and what will happen if the project is granted to save nature? A row has broken out in some parts of Cornwall and south Wales following the start of this year. Environmental experts are asking for more information to meet the public to find out how they are preparing to take action to prevent the development of an open cast quary in Carmarthenshire, the BBC understands, but what has happened when it was approved by Mannok mining company behind the proposed project? This week, BBC Scotland has learned from the Celt.</p>
