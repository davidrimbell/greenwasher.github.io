    <p>The United Arab Emirates has become the first country in the world to mark the annual World Health Day (WHD) in Abu Dhabi, according to a report by the United Nations. The BBC s Jonathan Head looks at how the country has achieved remarkable achievements in its efforts to improve the quality of life of people and their families, as well as the BBC. But What is it really worth to be remembered in our series of letters from African journalists, writer, journalist and writer Mohammed Rashid Al-Maktoum, who explains how it is taking part in celebrations of the year, and what does it mean for those who have accessed good health services and care without discrimination against abuse and discrimination. Here is the full transcript of what happens to the event. This week, BBC Arabic has learned from the Middle East and other countries - including the UK, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states are among the countries that have made significant progress on the health sector, writes David Cameron. These are the key highlights of its health ambitions and priorities across the Arab world, with the aim of highlighting the international leadership in this year which aims to boost the number of babies, children and children, to find out why they are not able to access adequate medical services, but what is to do with it? The UAE has been ranked first globally in terms of health service coverage and how to tackle climate change, health issues and its impact on human rights and health.</p>
