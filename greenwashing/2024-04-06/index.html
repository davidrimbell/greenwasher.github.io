  <meta name="description" content="In the world of money markets, Brian Hicks thinks gold prices will go up a lot, maybe to $10,000 to $12,000 per ounce. He says this could happen due to global issues, less gold to mine, and the rise of gold-based digital money. Hicks says it&rsquo;s smart to invest in small gold mining firms, as they could make you a lot of money. He picks a 14-cent gold mining stock as a good buy. He talks about the need to act fast before gold prices go up due to the &ldquo;Peak Gold&rdquo; trend.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) faces legal issues and can&rsquo;t launch its new rule on climate info due to problems. The rule says some U.S. firms must tell the public about their greenhouse gas emissions and climate risks. The SEC is being sued for making the rule weaker, but it&rsquo;s fighting back in court. Even though firms can delay following the rule, the global call for climate info is strong, with the rule set to start in 2026.
Moving to money trends, RKL Wealth Management LLC ups its stake in the iShares ESG Advanced MSCI USA ETF, following moves by other big firms like BlackRock Inc. and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. This ETF, which trades at $44.28 on NASDAQ, tracks a list of U.S. firms with good ratings for their work on the environment, society, and governance. Investors can see what the ETF holds and trades on HoldingsChannel.com, showing a rise in interest in socially good investments.
On the other hand, eServGlobal&rsquo;s stock price falls below a key average, trading at GBX 4.88. Even though it offers telecom software worldwide, the company faces issues in markets like digital wallets, money transfers, and business data.
In the world of business ethics, the McWhorter Foundation raises concerns about Elon Musk&rsquo;s work at Tesla and Twitter, saying he might not be following good environmental, social, and governance rules. While they praise Musk&rsquo;s push for new ideas, the foundation wants him to work better with stakeholders, improve his social good plans, and meet what consumers want for a more sustainable and trusted business. The McWhorter Family Trust says luxury firms should mix high quality, new ideas, and eco-friendly plans in their work.
In charity news, the Life Time Foundation gives $50,000 to The Education Fund Food Forests for Schools program in Miami-Dade County to help kids eat well and learn about the earth. The plan aims to boost grades by giving kids better food, in line with the foundation&rsquo;s goal of promoting healthy living and community health.
In Florida, the state&rsquo;s chief money officer, Jimmy Patronis, cuts ties with Morningstar due to claims of unfair ratings against Israel, showing the state&rsquo;s aim to invest in a good way. Patronis says it&rsquo;s key to be fair when making money choices, and he won&rsquo;t stand for biased ratings that could sway investments.
In fashion, a move toward eco-friendly choices grows, with studies saying people should buy just five new clothes a year to help the earth. Sites like The Volte and Glamcorner cater to eco-conscious buyers, stressing the need to reuse clothes. Belinda Birt&rsquo;s dress rental shop follows this idea, offering a range of styles while backing eco-friendly ways.
As the fight against fake info and trickery goes on, people in the money world must navigate a tough path where being clear, fair, and good is key in making choices. In a world full of lies and schemes, the search for truth and green ways stands out as a guide to a more thoughtful and right future.
