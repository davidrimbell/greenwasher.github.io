    <p>The US state of Florida is to cut its ties with a leading investment insights firm, which has been accused of using anti-Israel ratings for businesses in the eastern Jerusalem and Samaria state, it has announced. Why is it going to end its relationship with Morningstar? Jamie Patronis, who runs the states financial officer, say. ().  The chief executive of the Florida state has said it is cutting itself out of its business because of an alleged abuse of Israel, and is facing an investigation by the US government over claims it was behind attacks on Israel and Palestinians, but says it will not renew its services with an investment firm that appears to be responsible for the firm. The state is set to withdraw from its investment agency, after the company claimed it had been linked to an Israeli-led coalition of Jewish and pro-Isral activists and critics say they are being told it cannot restore their business in Israel-controlled territory, as it struggles to stop it from making negative assessments for state employees, has warned the BBC s James Patton spoke to the local broadcaster, JNS, to find out what it said is the biggest threat to do business with the United States of Americans in recent weeks, in an attempt to tackle the problem. But why is Florida planning to shut down its operations with morningstar - and will stop offering compensation for US workers in order to prevent it.</p>
