  <meta name="description" content="Consumers around the world are increasingly concerned about living more sustainable lifestyles, with 75% of them willing to make changes, according to a report by Alibaba. This sentiment is particularly strong in Asian countries, with 93% of Filipinos expressing a desire to live more sustainably. However, there are several barriers that prevent people from making sustainable choices.
One of the main obstacles is the lack of information. Many consumers are unaware of the environmental impact of the products they buy and the companies they support. This lack of transparency allows companies to engage in deceptive practices, such as greenwashing. Greenwashing refers to the act of making false or misleading claims about the environmental benefits of a product or company.
Companies often use terms like &ldquo;recycled&rdquo; or &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; to market their products as environmentally friendly. However, these terms can be misleading and misrepresent the true impact of the product. For example, the term &ldquo;recycled gold&rdquo; is often used to imply that the gold used in jewelry is sourced from recycled materials and does not contribute to mining. In reality, this is often not the case, as the term can be applied to gold that is simply reused or repurposed, rather than being sourced from discarded materials.
Another barrier to sustainable consumption is the high price of sustainable products. Many consumers are willing to make sustainable choices, but they are deterred by the higher cost. This highlights the need for companies to make sustainable options more affordable and accessible to a wider range of consumers.
Convenience is also a factor that influences consumers&#39; choices. Many people are willing to make sustainable choices, but only if they are convenient. This highlights the importance of making sustainable options more readily available and easy to incorporate into everyday life.
In addition to these barriers, there are also concerns about the integrity of companies&#39; claims. Green marketing, also known as eco-washing or sustainability washing, refers to the practice of companies exaggerating or misrepresenting their environmental credentials. This can include false advertising, dishonesty, and deceit.
The issue of greenwashing extends beyond consumer choices. It also has implications for the financial sector. Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards are increasingly being used to measure companies&#39; approach to social and environmental issues. However, there is pushback from conservative groups who argue against these standards. Anti-ESG bills have been introduced in several state legislatures, highlighting the political divide on this issue.
The urgency of addressing climate change and promoting sustainability cannot be overstated. Climate scientists warn that July 2023 is expected to be the hottest month ever recorded, and extreme weather events are already causing devastating consequences. UN Secretary-General António Guterres has called for immediate global action on emissions reduction and climate adaptation and finance. He has also urged financial institutions and fossil fuel companies to shift their investments and operations towards renewable energy.
While there are challenges and barriers to overcome, there is still hope for a more sustainable future. Consumers have the power to demand transparency and hold companies accountable for their claims. Governments and international organizations have a role to play in creating policies and regulations that promote sustainability. And individuals can make a difference through their everyday choices and actions.
By staying informed and aware of greenwashing practices, consumers can make more informed decisions and contribute to a greener and more sustainable world for future generations.
