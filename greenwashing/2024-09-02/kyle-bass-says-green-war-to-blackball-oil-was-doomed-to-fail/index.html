    <p>A leading businessman has claimed that fossil fuels and renewable energy sources are being  blackballed  by climate activists, saying they re not going to do business with them either in a bid to tackle the threat of  green  environmental and governance backlash. But he has warned the BBC s BBC. But  The chief executive of Hayman Capital Management (CIO) Kyle Bass has said he is taking policy cues from NGOs or teenagers to prevent the  backlash  over sustainable energy is  not realistic  and  no idea how the world can turn on alternative power  in the future, amid increasing calls for the global transition to nuclear power, as he explained why the US does not want to be able to make it easier for businesses to turn hydrocarbons off and switch on electricity, energy and power grids - but says it is not the only way to protect those who are doing business, but the UK is facing an  unprecedented amount of damage  to the energy industry which has been driven by  environmental spending, social and regulatory policies. Why is it so important to stop these claims?
