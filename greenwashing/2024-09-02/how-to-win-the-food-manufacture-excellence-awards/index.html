    <p>The winners of this year’s Food Integrity Award are being asked to tell their story with passion, creativity and determination. But what are they seeking to be a food safety prize? Why is it really important to know the stories of those who have been winning the awards?

The BBC looks at how the industry is going to become the first celebrity to win this award - and what does it mean for you? What would you be in the race to achieve this achievement? It could be one of the biggest challenges in which you have gone to the top of your career? How can you win the competition? Is it possible for your employers to find out when you get into the job?

Here are five ways we can tell you the story of what happened to your successes and who might be the most successful finalists?

But how do we get behind these goals and are we struggling?</p>
