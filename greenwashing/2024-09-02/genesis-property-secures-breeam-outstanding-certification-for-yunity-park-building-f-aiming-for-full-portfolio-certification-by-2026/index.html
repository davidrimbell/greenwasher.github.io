    <p>A leading building owners in Romania have been awarded the highest level of sustainability standards for building management, according to a report from the UK’s Environmental Protection Agency (EEA) on Tuesday. Genesis Property has become the first building in the country to achieve this recognition - and says it is committed to reducing carbon emissions to zero from its operations by 2024. But What is it likely to be one of the world s most sustainable buildings in their housing strategy, the BBC has learned. The BBC understands how it has achieved the top level in-use assessment of building performance and its impact on the environment and the impact of greenhouse gases, energy consumption and energy use in its built environment, and is taking steps to tackle environmental challenges which are being tackled by the European Green Deal initiatives to reduce climate change and reduce the costs of its building operations in Europe and around the planet. But what does it mean for the company? Why is this one really important to meet its ambitious ambitions and what is the key to its success in creating an innovative building, but why has it reached an international safety achievement? A BBC investigation looks at how the building is at the centre of this challenge, writes David Robson, who has been given the green light on how to improve the quality of construction and use of energy and green energy, as well as where it can be treated in an environmentally-friendly environment? What could it be done to save the lives of all those involved in it?</p>
