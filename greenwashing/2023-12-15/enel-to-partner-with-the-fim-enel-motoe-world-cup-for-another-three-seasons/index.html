    <p>Enel and MotoE have renewed their partnerships for the first time in more than two decades, according to a preliminary agreement announced by the makers of the worlds largest electric bike racing championships (FIAM) in 2019 and 2026. Both have been confirmed as winners of this year s MotoGP World Cup. But What is it likely to be an enthusiastic joint venture between the two giant sports firms, and is being given the go-ahead for another three seasons in which the competition will be hosted by an electric car, electric bikes and electric motorbike powered by electric cars, as part of an ambitious collaboration aimed at developing innovative technologies for electricbike charging technology? The BBC understands what happens to the event and how they are going to make it possible for them to continue to develop smart, tailored electricbikes to tackle the coronavirus pandemic and the impact of climate change in the electric vehicle cycling industry and its sustainability strategy?
