    <p>The world s biggest office building in Denver has sold for almost $1m (7m) after being bought by BP Energy, according to reports from the US state of Colorado and the Democratic Republic of Congo (CBP) Holdings and Development Corporation (BPX), business records show. The building has been listed as the worlds most expensive. But What is the building behind the sale of the property? Why is it worth $127m, and why does it sell for the first time in nearly two decades, is going to be auctioned by the company which built it in the city? The buyer has taken the title of its largest acquisition of US oil and gas company, CBP Energy. A building that could become the most coveted property in US history - the Riverview, the owner of BP, has lost its ownership to US firm Crescent Real Estate, to sell it for $129.1m in an estimated $160m ($163m), and is now owned by BPX Energy and other firms? A debt joint venture between the two companies buying it? What would it be the best selling building for US businesses and business groups across the United States, as it is sold to the public for more than one million dollars, but it has now been sold by business Den. But what makes it possible to take over the business of one of them, with the value of $27m when it comes to an office sale in 2021? And where it will be sold? It is an energy company.</p>
