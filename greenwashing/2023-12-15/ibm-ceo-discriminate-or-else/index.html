The BBCs Larry Madowo looks at the challenges facing those who claim they would have lost their bonuses, and asks the BBC s Victoria Derbyshire columnist, James OKeefe, who has been. (). What does it mean for people of different races to be able to apply for the job - and why is it so often being rejected by quotas, which means it cannot be discriminatory against each other, writes David Robson, the director of the Institute of Human Rights in New York, on the issue of equity, true equality and true inclusity, as he explains what makes it harder to think about the differences in the way the company is approaching what is needed to make it more diverse than it is.
