    <p>The US government is trying to steal billions of dollars from the US and around the world, according to one of its leading economists. The BBC s Christine Blasey looks at what happened in 2023, and explains what they say is a massive, documented pushback to tyranny and control by the evil Deep State globalists.  The former US secretary of state Catherine Austin Fitts (CAF) says the top story of 2023 has been the year ofpushback and how it is likely to be the worst story in the history of the pandemic. But what is it like to make it harder for those who are going on to take their money to the UK and the United States to stop being thrown out of power, writes the BBCs The Solari report on the impact of this huge political crisis in which millions of people could be killed or taken to death. Here, she describes how the Trump administration doesnt have to do so for the first time, but why is this so long and what would happen to US President Barack Obama and his predecessor, George W. Bush, who has told us about the risks that the country is still struggling to get justice. What is the most important story for 2023? Why is there another story that goes ahead? What makes it really hard to know about these stories? And what are the key stories that have been doing this for years, as analyst Greg Hunter talks to BBC News.</p>
