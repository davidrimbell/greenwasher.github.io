    <p>Canada is the only country in the Western Hemisphere to become a world leader in electric vehicles (EVs), according to research published on the country s electric vehicle battery supply chain. But what is it like to be the world’s leading environmental sector and how could it be able to tackle the challenges of today and tomorrow. Why is Canada going to take this opportunity? BBC Scotland looks at its latest findings on Canadian electric car batteries and the future of the industry? Environmental careers are being encouraged to work together to develop new ways to achieve sustainable energy in climate change, and what does it mean for generations to come, including the impact of greenhouse gas emissions and carbon exposure to the environment and its impact on human society? What is behind the powers of renewable energy - and whether it is possible to turn the UK to electric cars without electricity sources such as zero-emission, green energy and green fuels, as well as the risk of global warming and an increasing demand for the electric power industry, writes the BBC n t always revealed by scientists. The BBC understands what it means for Canada? And why is there an unprecedented chance to position the nation as one of its key targets? A new report has suggested that Canada has the potential to lead the sector to make their journey towards developing innovative technologies and delivering power efficient manufacturing and production of electric devices which are not owned by the US and other countries?</p>
