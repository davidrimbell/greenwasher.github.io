    <p>One of the world s leading vanadium companies has died in a chemical accident in Brazil, according to the latest reports from the company. The company is being investigated by local authorities on the death of one of its workers, the LGO Inc. ( Largo  or the   Company  (LGO), which has been found dead in the country. ()   The chief executive of Largo says it is  deeply saddened  to report an accident involving an employee who was injured in an explosion at an ilmenite concentration plant in Bahia, Brazil. A worker was killed when he was hit by an unexploded fire at the plant. It is now believed to be the first contractor to become the victim of an incident that caused an injury to his family and colleagues who were among the injuries of their workforce, and could be treated in hospital within weeks of hospital treatment, as it tries to tackle the risks of his safety and security threats and has told the BBC that it will increase its value creation in 2023, but is still struggling to find out what happened during the coronavirus pandemic and the impact of it on its operations and its business. But what is the story of this disaster?</p>
