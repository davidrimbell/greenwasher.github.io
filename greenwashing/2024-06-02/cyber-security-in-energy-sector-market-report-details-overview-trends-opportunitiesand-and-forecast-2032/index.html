    <p>Cyber security in the energy sector is expected to increase by a third in 2028, according to new analysis by Allied Market Research, the world s biggest cyber security forecast for the year twice as likely as 2024 - and could reach $25bn (£27m) by 2022. These are the key factors behind the surge in cyberattacks. Процесс growth is set to be accelerated by cyber attacks and cyber-attacks across the globe, as well as the rise in computer-based technologies which threaten businesses to protect the sector from cyber attacking targets within the power generation, transmission and distribution systems, and an increasing number of sophisticated devices including smartphones and mobile phones. The growing amount of cybersecurity has contributed to the global expansion of the industry, but experts have warned that they will be able to tackle rising risks to national security and public safety during the coronavirus pandemic, with reports suggesting the country is now struggling to cope with the economic recovery of energy infrastructure and the impact on the development of digital technology, such as computer networks, mobile networks and internet providers, in order to combat cyberthreats. But what does this mean for those who are planning their efforts to stop cyberattacking, is not always enough to help the market become more vulnerable to cyber crimes, or cybercrimes in power and power sectors? Why is it going to grow? The BBC looks at how it can be affected by the UK.</p>
