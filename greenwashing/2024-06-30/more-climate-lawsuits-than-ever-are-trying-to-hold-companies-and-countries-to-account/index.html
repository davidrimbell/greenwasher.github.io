    <p>The number of new climate lawsuits against governments and corporations could be slowing, according to a new report released by the Grantham Institute. Climate lawsuit cases are still on the rise across the world, but their growth may not be accelerating, writes the BBC s Jane Ciabatte, who looks at the impact of the crisis. (). How is the global warming threat to be handled by scientists in the UK is being investigated by BBC Newsnight. The latest report has revealed that there is an increasing amount of legal action to tackle the risk of further damage to the environment and the future of our society, and is likely to continue to grow within the next decade. Here is what we learned about the effects of this rising global litigation - and what does it mean for the human rights industry? Why is it going to take another step in efforts to protect our environment? The BBC has been asked to find out what happened in this year, with reports from environmental experts looking at how they are spreading to new countries in 2023, as well as why the US is now the leader in legal prosecutions that appear to have significantly higher than in previous years. But what are the key causes of such claims? What would be the most rapidly expanded during the past two years and how will it be affecting our lives? And what will happen if it comes to change when it is not reaching its targets.</p>
