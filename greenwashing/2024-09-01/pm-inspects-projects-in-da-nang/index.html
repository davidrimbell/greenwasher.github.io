    <p>The first inspections of the site of what will be the first free trade zone in Vietnam have taken place in the city of Đà Nẵng on Saturday, a day after the prime minister visited the area. The BBC s Christine Lagarde looks at what it is likely to be known as the latest investigation into the possibility of land reclamation material usage.  () The chief minister has told the BBC why it has been given the go-ahead for the development of an area which is being developed for business, trade, service and tourism, as well as how to avoid land-based construction. Here are some of those who are taking part in their first visit to the country. This is the story of how the world is prepared to develop the new territory, and how it can be used to attract high-quality investment, finance, business and trade. What is it going to happen and what does it mean for businesses, services and services, but what is there to take on the environment and the future of its development? Why is this really important to look at these areas? Here is what happened in its first round of visits. It is an opportunity to find out what the government is considering to make it more easier to build, to save time and costs compared to land based on land and commercial developments, with the aim of creating an alternative to sea - and not when it comes to building the free Trade Zone, how could it be transformed into an international model for its future, writes BBC Newsnight.</p>
