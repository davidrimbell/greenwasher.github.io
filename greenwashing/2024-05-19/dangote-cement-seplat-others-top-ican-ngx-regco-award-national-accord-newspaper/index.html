    <p>The winners of a prestigious annual corporate reporting award have been announced in Lagos, Nigeria, on Monday. They have become the first listed companies to win awards. The BBC s Aliko Dangote looks at the achievements.. But what is the best way to ensure transparency, accountability and sustainability is being improved. (). Here is what the award has been awarded for the year under review, according to the Nigerian Financial Reports Association (NGX RegCo) and the top 30 most capitalised companies in the countrys financial industry. Among them, the most worth of money spent on the private sector, and how they are taking part in their efforts to tackle corruption, management and management of the state of Nigeria - and what does it mean for those who have won this year? These are the key nominees for this award. Here are three leading companies named as the leaders of three companies, who secured the gold and silver award, as part of an award which has taken place in Nigeria. This year, three of them have received two gold medals and three gold prize nominations to be given to two companies that have achieved more than two years since it was launched in recent years, but what has happened during the pandemic and its impact on businesses across the world, in particular when it takes place, with the names of two giant companies who were crowned as top earnings from the NGX Regco, or corporations that failed to achieve the same goals.</p>
