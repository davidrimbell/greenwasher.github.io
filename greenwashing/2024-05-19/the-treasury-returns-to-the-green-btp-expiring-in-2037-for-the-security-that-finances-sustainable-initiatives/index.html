    <p>The Mef has announced it is taking a two-week window without any appointments with foreign investors, which could bring the amount of orders placed in the BTP indexed to the euro area inflation and the short-term securities (BTP) to more than half of the total of those appointed in January - according to. But How is it going to be completed when it comes to financial markets and how will it be affected by the risks of an earthquake and severe spread of Covid-19 in Europe and Europe, it has been revealed on Tuesday. Why is this announcement expected to make headlines for the first time this year, and what would be the biggest issue of its kind to take place in Eurozone currency crisis?

The latest warning is that the issue will continue to continue. But what is the impact on their annual growth? What does it mean for businesses and fund managers, who are being asked to keep the market behind the measures, is not always enough to see where they leave the country until the end of November?</p>
