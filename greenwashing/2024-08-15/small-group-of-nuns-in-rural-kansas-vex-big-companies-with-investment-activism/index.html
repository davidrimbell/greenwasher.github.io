    <p>In our series of letters from African journalists, we speak to a growing number of nuns in Kansas City. The BBC s weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we look at some of the most persistent shareholder activists on the globe, including those who have taken on their corporate responsibility programme. What is it? BBC News Larry Madowo looks at how many companies are investing in the US, and why are they increasingly likely to be politically polarised? Why are these women taking on social media to take on companies which are not always going to do so? What does it mean for businesses to make it easier for them to invest in companies that would be more wealthy than many of them? And what is the answer to the BBC’s Victoria Derbyshire columnist, Kan Mitchell, who explains what happens to business giant Chevron, writes the story of one of its most powerful entrepreneurs in recent years and what could be the biggest threat to Americans and how corporations can make them more profitable? Here is what we learned about the impact of business in America. They have been calling for the company to change policies based on human rights, but what are we actually doing to stop them from being able to get involved in business, as well as how much it can be done to tackle the problem? The chief executives are so obsessed with intellectual property - and who is talking about them.</p>
