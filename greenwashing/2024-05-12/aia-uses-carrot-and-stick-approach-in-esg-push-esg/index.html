    <p>The threat of divestment or exclusion is increasing in Asia, according to a major insurer in the Asia-Pacific region, the Asian Investors Group (AI) has revealed. However, it is still being encouraged to look for opportunities for active ownership in companies which are struggling to achieve sustainable developments. The BBC s Diana.
