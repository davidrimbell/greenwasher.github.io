It is not always the only way to tackle the problem, writes BBC News Africa presenter Penny Dale, who says it has become the first person to give evidence of an environmentally-friendly material that does not end up on the market, but how much it can be saved from hazardous amounts which makes it harder than those that have been removed from the plastic carriers in recent weeks, as part of its efforts to make it more efficiently than ever?</p>
