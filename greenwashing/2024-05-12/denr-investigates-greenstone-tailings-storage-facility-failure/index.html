    <p>The government has called for an immediate investigation into the cause of a faulty mining facility in Mindanao, which has caused damage to hundreds of homes and businesses in the north-east of the country. Officials have said it is being investigated by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) to investigate the risks.. But  The authorities have warned that residents are evacuated from their homes because of its safety and well-being, as well as the impact on communities and the environment, they have been told to be treated as hazardous and de-risk operations in areas where buildings were destroyed and more than 4,000 homes were displaced by cracks and other serious structural failures linked to the seismicity of our country s sea-level flooding, causing severe disasters, and it has been described as an  unprecedented  incident in Surigao del Norte, in what could be the worst incident since the deadly collapse of one of Greenstone Resources in south-west Mozambique, but officials have asked the government to take action to assess the extent of an incident following the death of at least 15 houses and injuries in some parts of south coast provinces for the first time in nearly two decades, after it was discovered in an area known as Tubod, on the island of Rivers in South America, to find out why it failed. The BBC understands how it affected the area.</p>
