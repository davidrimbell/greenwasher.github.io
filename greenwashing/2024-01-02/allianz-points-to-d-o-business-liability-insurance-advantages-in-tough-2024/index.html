    <p>The coronavirus pandemic is threatening business liability insurance, according to a leading insurance giant which says it is  unlikely  it will continue to be able to cope with the hard market conditions that developed across the globe until 2024, the company has warned. However, it could change as the world continues to suffer from the coronavirus. (). The BBC s weekly The Boss series profiles some of the most significant challenges facing business insurance companies - including financial lines and private companies  and experts are warning that the global economy is at risk of being damaged by severe economic crises and cyber risks, but they are still increasing their coverage, and the industry is now struggling to find out why it has become the worst of its kind in the past decade, as well as rising costs of refinancing debt and high settlement values, such as low interest rates and low revenue increases in loans and credit rises. The latest report suggests that there is no risk to continue for those who buy business safety insurance for the future of this type of insurance that will be affected by the Covid-19 lockdown restrictions on businesses and business services during the next few years, to see if the UK remains at its highest levels of risk, despite economic difficulties coming to an end to the virus crisis, in particular for business companies, who are not expected to survive this recovery, writes Allianz.</p>
