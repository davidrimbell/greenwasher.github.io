    <p>The BBC s weekly The Boss series profiles different topics from around the world. This week we look at some of the most interesting and influential stories from across the country. Here are five of those we ve been talking about this week. These are the highlights of what happened in the US and what is happening to the people who have a huge amount. () What is the BBCs most recently released coverage of this article. What are we going to do with these readers and their favourites?
