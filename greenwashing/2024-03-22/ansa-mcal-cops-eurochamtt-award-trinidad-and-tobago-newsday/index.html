    <p>The group behind Trinidad and Tobagos Ansa McAl Group has been awarded the overall sustainability champion of the European business chamber in 2024, EuroChamTT, a year after the group was recognised as the world s leading environmental and social initiatives group, the BBC has learned. These are the names of those who have taken part. But (). The annual awards ceremony is being held at the Brix Hotel, Port of Spain, on Friday 22 March, and they are among the members of an organisation that has announced it has received an award for its sustainable strategy and their leadership in the region, as part of its campaign to tackle climate change, economic growth, social and economic issues and its impact on its business. The organisation says it is celebrating its new achievements and will be given the chance to become the first group to win the EU business Chamber of Europe to recognise the organisation. A joint executive assistant, Frances Bain-Cumberbatch, who was appointed as chief legal and external affairs boss, Shweta Sharma, has said it will take part in an effort to push the country towards renewable spending in its sectors, but is now expected to receive another award, after winning the award this year, with an international award of 100m (200m) - which includes financial and human rights benefits for the company. Here is the full list of business leaders from across the UK and Canada. This year takes place at an event in London.</p>
