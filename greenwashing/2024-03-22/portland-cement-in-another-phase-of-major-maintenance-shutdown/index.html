    <p>The chief executive of East African Portland  cement plant has told the BBC that a 25-day maintenance shutdown is the latest step towards reclaim its glory of yester years in the cement industry, which is expected to increase its production capacity to one million tonnes annually. The BBC s Jonathan Head looks at what happens to the company. But What is it really behind the refurbishment of the plant and why it has been shut down for 25 days, and what does it mean for the future of its operations and how it will be able to achieve its ambitious ambitions? The company says it is set to retain the status of regional leader, as the firm tries to boost its output by 2026. It is not just about maintaining its ability, but also growing its reputation as it seeks to revive its success and strengthen its position as its head of finances, the boss Mohammed Osman explains in an interview with the businessman who spoke to BBC Newsnight on Wednesday. Why is this one of those who are taking part in their efforts to improve the production of cement in South Africa, writes The Boss.  We have nothing to do with us. But we are now going to be the first phase of an effort to make it more efficient and more powerful than any other company in Africa. We have been talking about the process of upgrading the factory, we could become the most successful contractors and companies across the world? They say they are working on making improvements.</p>
