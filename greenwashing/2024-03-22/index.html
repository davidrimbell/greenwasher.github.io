  <meta name="description" content="Greenwashing is when companies trick people with fake claims about being eco-friendly. It&rsquo;s important for consumers to watch out for this because it can be misleading and bad for the environment. Companies use tricky language and images to make themselves seem more green than they really are.
One example of greenwashing is BlackRock, a big investment firm that got in trouble for pulling money out of Texas energy companies, saying it was for financial reasons, not politics. This made people talk about how investment firms struggle to balance making money with helping the environment.
In Canada, people are worried about businesses lying about being eco-friendly, especially in Quebec. They want companies to show they are making progress on environmental goals. It&rsquo;s important to have strong rules and checks to stop companies from lying about being green.
Companies like Cranswick and East African Portland Cement are working to be more eco-friendly. Cranswick hired Rachel Horvath, who knows a lot about human resources, to help them. East African Portland Cement upgraded their plant to make more cement in a greener way.
Consumers need to be careful of greenwashing so they can choose to support truly eco-friendly companies. By learning how companies trick people into thinking they are green, consumers can avoid falling for lies and help create a better future for the environment.
