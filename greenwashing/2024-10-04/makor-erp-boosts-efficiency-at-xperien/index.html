  <meta name="description" content=" Xperien, an IT Asset Disposition (ITAD) solutions provider, has implemented the Makor ERP system to enhance governance and operational excellence. The ERP system has significantly improved inventory management, data security, and impact reporting for the company. CEO Wale Arewa highlights the system s efficiency in centralising inventory data, automating disposal processes, and optimising inventory management. This has led to reduced carrying costs, improved demand forecasting, and prompt customer service.  The Makor ERP system has also transformed the end-of-life cycle for IT asset disposal, minimising delays and errors, and providing accurate tracking of asset location, condition, and status. This enhanced visibility has improved decision-making, mitigated data loss and theft incidents, and optimized asset utilisation, resulting in cost savings for Xperien and its clients.  Moreover, the system offers comprehensive analytics and impact reporting tools, enabling Xperien s management to make data-driven decisions that enhance overall efficiency and contribute to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) goals. Access to historical performance data, customer preferences, and market trends allows for strategic planning and proactive measures.  The automation of routine tasks and optimization of workflows through Makor ERP have reduced operational throughput and minimised downtime at Xperien. Employees can focus on value-added activities, leading to a more engaged and productive workforce. Additionally, the system s preventive maintenance features have increased equipment uptime and reduced repair expenses.  Overall, the adoption of Makor ERP has been a transformational journey for Xperien, empowering the company to operate with unprecedented efficiency and precision in the ITAD industry. The system s ability to automate processes, optimize workflows, and provide data-driven insights has redefined how Xperien operates."/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://green-washer.com/greenwashing/2024-10-04/makor-erp-boosts-efficiency-at-xperien/">
