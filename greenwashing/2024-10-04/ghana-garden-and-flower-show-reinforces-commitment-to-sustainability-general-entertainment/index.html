  <meta name="description" content=" The 12th Annual Ghana Garden and Flower Show, held from September 22 to September 29, 2024, at Accra’s Efua Sutherland Children’s Park, showcased a strong commitment to sustainability and climate change. The event, which gathered industry leaders, environmental advocates, and gardening enthusiasts, aimed to find new solutions to environmental challenges.  Stratcomm Africa s Dr. Angela Asare described the show as a movement that embodies responsible business practices, emphasizing the integration of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) values into everyday operations and community life. The event promoted community engagement and empowerment, serving as a knowledge exchange center for farmers and businesspeople to learn sustainable agriculture techniques.  Participants were educated on contemporary farming methods that can increase productivity and economic prosperity. The show also highlighted the importance of plants in carbon sequestration, with environmentalist Ama Abena emphasizing the need for increased tree planting and biodiversity conservation efforts.  The event s goals included promoting environmentally friendly practices, reducing single-use plastics, and boosting recycling to build a circular economy that minimizes waste and conserves resources.  Beyond environmental considerations, the Ghana Garden and Flower Show also serves as a job creator, particularly for young people and women. The show equips participants with the necessary skills for success in the green economy and connects entrepreneurs with potential investors and partners, fostering a supportive ecosystem for long-term business success.  In summary, the Ghana Garden and Flower Show is a significant event that promotes sustainable practices, environmental awareness, and economic growth, while also empowering communities and creating job opportunities in the horticulture and floriculture industries."/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://green-washer.com/greenwashing/2024-10-04/ghana-garden-and-flower-show-reinforces-commitment-to-sustainability-general-entertainment/">
