  <meta name="description" content="In today&rsquo;s world, people care more about the environment than ever before. But the problem of greenwashing is still big. Greenwashing is when companies pretend to be eco-friendly, but they are not. This tricks people into thinking they are helping the planet when they are not. It also makes real environmental efforts harder and can cost people money.
One example is Constellation Energy&rsquo;s plan to fix and restart Reactor 1 at Three Mile Island by 2028. Microsoft is the only customer for the electricity from this project, which is said to be a clean energy plan. But some people think it might hide money problems by promising economic benefits. The project costs $1.6 billion and has a federal loan guarantee, which could mean taxpayers have to pay if things go wrong. The electricity will go into the larger power grid, not directly to Microsoft, which makes the project seem less honest. Critics want Constellation and Microsoft to be clear about the project&rsquo;s real impact and costs to avoid tricking people.
In the airline industry, Professor Richard Steinberg talks about &ldquo;ghost flights.&rdquo; These are flights airlines run just to keep their airport slots, which adds to pollution. Steinberg suggests using the PAUSE system, a method that uses auctions to give out airport slots more efficiently. This could cut down on pollution and costs, providing a real solution to this environmental issue.
People need to be careful about greenwashing. By asking for honesty and responsibility, they can make sure their choices really help the environment. Public opinion is important in this. When people learn about tricks, they can push companies to be truly sustainable.
There are examples of how public opinion can change things. For instance, when a well-known clothing brand was caught making false eco-friendly claims, customers demanded change. The brand then became more open and improved its sustainability efforts. This shows how public opinion can make companies more accountable.
Knowing about greenwashing helps people make better choices. By understanding the tricks companies use, people can support real efforts to make the world better for future generations. Let&rsquo;s work together to uncover these tricks and support true sustainability.

    <br/> Malaysian Association of Hotels (MAH) Sarawak Chapter Chairman John Teo advocates for extending the income tax exemption currently granted to one to three-star hotels with Pioneer Status to four and five-star hotels. This move, he believes, will attract high-end tourists, increase national revenue, and promote sustainable practices, digital innovation, and workforce development.  Teo emphasizes the need for a comprehensive and tax-efficient strategy to benefit Malaysia s tourism sector and position the country as a leading global destination. He suggests that applying the same incentives to higher-end hotels will encourage investment in sustainable and competitive practices.  In addition to the tax exemption, Teo and his association members have been pushing for more tailored incentives, accelerated capital allowances, and tax reliefs for tourism industry players. These issues have been consistently raised in discussions and town hall meetings with relevant ministries since 2021.  Furthermore, MAH has called for green incentives, grants, or tax relief for hotels that meet the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) certification criteria. This aligns with the Ministry of Tourism, Arts, and Culture s National Tourism Policy 2030, which promotes sustainable practices in the tourism industry.  Regarding the hotel check-in and check-out time policy, Teo states that the issue of some hotels implementing a check-in time of 4pm and a check-out time of 11am is not a major concern in Sarawak. Hotel managements in the region are reportedly flexible, which helps mitigate any potential inconvenience for guests.  Overall, Teo s suggestions aim to enhance Malaysia s tourism sector by providing tax incentives, promoting sustainable practices, and encouraging investment in the industry. These measures are expected to attract high-end tourists, increase national revenue, and contribute to a sustainable and competitive economy.

    <br/> California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed Senate Bill 219, amending the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act and the Climate-Related Financial Risk Act. The amendments extend the deadline for the adoption of regulations for GHG emissions reporting to July 1, 2025, and delay the timeline for Scope 3 emissions disclosure to 2027. Reports can now be consolidated at the parent company level. The annual fee for reporting is no longer due at the time of filing. The Climate-Related Financial Risk Act still requires companies to report on climate-related financial risks by January 1, 2026, and every two years thereafter. The implementation of these laws is not stayed pending a court case. Companies should assess their compliance needs and prepare accordingly. The Voluntary Carbon Market Disclosure Act remains in effect with a compliance deadline of January 1, 2025.

    <a href="https://green-washer.com/greenwashing/2024-10-04/how-airports-can-get-rid-of-ghost-flights-once-and-for-all/">How Airports Can Get Rid Of Ghost Flights Once And For All</a>
    <br/> Professor Richard Steinberg, an expert in auctions and internet economics, discusses the growing issue of airport congestion due to the rapid increase in international air transportation demand. He highlights the inefficiency of the current slot allocation system, which allows airlines to retain slots indefinitely if used 80% of the time, leading to wasteful practices like  ghost flights.  Steinberg suggests that slot auctions could be a more efficient solution, as economic theory and historical data indicate that they would increase airport capacity, reduce flight delays, and lower costs for both airlines and passengers.  Steinberg proposes a combinatorial auction procedure called PAUSE (Progressive Adaptive User Selection Environment) to address the winner determination problem, which arises when trying to allocate slots in large auctions. PAUSE operates in stages, allowing airlines to bid on individual slots and then package bids for multiple slots. This approach avoids the need to solve the complex winner determination problem, making it suitable for airport slot auctions of any size.  Steinberg emphasizes that introducing a combinatorial auction procedure like PAUSE is crucial now, as insufficient slot capacity and high carbon emissions have reached a critical stage. The PAUSE auction could help address these issues by enabling more efficient use of airport slots and reducing the incentive for ghost flights, ultimately contributing to meeting environmental targets set by ESG rating agencies.

    <a href="https://green-washer.com/greenwashing/2024-10-04/how-to-mobilize-private-climate-finance-the-manila-times/">How to mobilize private climate finance | The Manila Times</a>
    <br/> The article discusses the urgent need for global action to address the devastating effects of climate change, particularly in the context of the upcoming COP29 conference. It highlights the disproportionate impact on countries that have contributed least to the climate crisis and emphasizes the necessity for these nations to strengthen their green ambitions and build resilience against climate-related hazards. The article calls for a massive mobilization of finance to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and to support climate mitigation and adaptation efforts.  Denmark s successful transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy is cited as an example of the potential for rapid and large-scale shifts in energy systems. The article also points out the significant investment gap in emerging-market and developing economies (EMDEs), which require an estimated $2.4 trillion annually by 2030 for climate- and nature-related investments.  To address this gap, the article proposes three changes for development-finance institutions (DFIs):  1. Funding the development of a massive pipeline of green investments and climate adaptation projects, including early-stage large-scale projects and new technologies. 2. Scaling up the use of de-risking instruments, such as loan guarantees and insurance, to unlock private finance and reduce perceived risks in developing countries. 3. Mobilizing both external and domestic pools of capital, such as pension funds, to invest in green and sustainable projects in EMDEs.  The article also highlights the Investment Mobilization Collaboration Arrangement, a joint initiative by Denmark, the Nordic countries, and the United States, which aims to channel billions of dollars in climate finance toward mitigation and adaptation efforts by 2026.  In conclusion, the article urges governments, philanthropists, and private-sector partners to join forces in shaping a meaningful contribution to address the climate crisis. It emphasizes the need for a rapid and comprehensive response to the accelerating climate crisis and calls for a focus on blended finance solutions in international discussions leading up to COP29.

    <a href="https://green-washer.com/greenwashing/2024-10-04/new-economic-sustainability-paradigm-proposed/">New Economic - Sustainability Paradigm Proposed</a>
    <br/> A team of researchers led by Associate Professor Jan Pfister from the University of Turku in Finland proposes a new paradigm for economic performance and sustainability, emphasizing cooperation and ethical behavior as key drivers of success. This  prosocial market economy  model integrates these values into organizational practices, challenging traditional economic frameworks focused on self-interest and short-term gains.  The research, funded by the Research Council of Finland and published in Qualitative Research in Accounting &amp; Management, draws on evolutionary theory and insights from Nobel Prize-winning economist Elinor Ostrom. It suggests that organizations prioritizing collaboration and collective well-being outperform those driven solely by self-interest.  The prosocial market economy offers a framework for businesses to achieve economic success while contributing positively to environmental sustainability and social well-being. This approach is particularly relevant in the face of global challenges such as climate change, inequality, and resource depletion.  The interdisciplinary research, involving experts from Finland, the UK, USA, and the UAE, highlights the importance of integrating behavioral science and management studies to foster a more sustainable and cooperative economic system.  Practical tools are provided for organizations across industries, both in the private and public sectors, to design prosocial teams and foster collective success. The prosocial market economy focuses on transforming organizational cultures from within, embedding sustainability and cooperation into core values.  This research moves beyond the conventional Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) debate, which often relies on external measurements. The prosocial market economy emphasizes genuine, lasting sustainability, avoiding greenwashing and superficial ESG compliance.  In summary, the prosocial market economy offers a pathway for organizations to be both economically successful and environmentally and socially responsible, challenging traditional economic paradigms and promoting a more sustainable and cooperative future.

    <br/> The U.S. Supreme Court s 1984 Chevron deference standard, which allowed courts to defer to agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes, has been overturned by the June 2024 Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo decision. This change casts uncertainty on the SEC s ESG rule proposal, which requires investment funds to disclose their ESG investment practices. The SEC s authority to implement this rule is challenged due to the lack of explicit statutory support for such disclosures. The Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act, which the SEC cites as authority, do not mention ESG practices. Furthermore, the SEC s own 1975 guidance and a 2016 concept release indicate that it does not have the authority to mandate ESG disclosures unrelated to the objectives of federal securities laws. Consequently, the ESG rule proposal is likely to be vacated by the courts under the new Chevron standard.

    <br/> The global financial sector is increasingly pivotal in addressing climate change, with green bonds and sustainable finance tools gaining prominence. Singapore is at the forefront, integrating sustainable finance into its economic strategy. The growth in green bonds is driven by companies incorporating sustainability into their core strategies, influenced by regulatory pressures and market expectations. Investors are now more discerning, seeking investments that balance impact with financial returns, and are adopting sustainable finance frameworks and conducting rigorous ESG evaluations.  Green bonds have proven effective in achieving real environmental benefits, particularly when they have clear impact goals and strong oversight. For instance, UOB s financing of solar projects under its U-Solar programme has significantly reduced GHG emissions. To combat greenwashing, the financial sector emphasizes transparency, continuous monitoring, and external assurance.  Regulatory changes and technological innovations are shaping the sustainable finance landscape. Clear taxonomies and regulatory policies are encouraging market growth, while advances in data analytics and natural capital measurement tools are enhancing sustainability performance tracking. The focus on natural capital and biodiversity is a key trend, with the understanding that climate and nature issues are interdependent.  The evolution of green finance standards and benchmarks will continue to prioritize quality and transparency. The challenge lies in ensuring that regulations keep pace with decarbonization methods and technologies. The rise of green bonds and sustainable finance represents a crucial step in the global effort to combat climate change and transition towards a low-carbon future. The focus on transparency, rigorous standards, and innovative solutions will be essential in delivering the promised environmental and social impact.
