  <meta name="description" content=" The Port of Newcastle has maintained its 5-star GRESB rating for the fourth consecutive year, showcasing its dedication to sustainability and decarbonization. The port achieved a perfect score of 100% in climate change reporting, scenario analysis, and risk and opportunity identification. CEO Craig Carmody expressed pride in the team s efforts and emphasized ESG principles as a core part of the company s culture.  The Port of Newcastle is implementing a diversification strategy, with a focus on the Clean Energy Precinct, aiming to become a leading hub for sustainable energy products and technologies, such as hydrogen and green ammonia. The port handles various cargoes, including wheat, meals, grains, and wind turbine components, with increased roll-on-roll-off project cargo being a strong point this year.  The 5-star GRESB rating is reserved for the top 20% of surveyed companies globally, recognizing industry leaders in sustainability. The Port of Newcastle identified areas for improvement, including climate change, and has increased efforts to decarbonize operations, improve ESG reporting, and enhance governance around climate change and transition risk.  The port s commitment to sustainability extends to creating a diverse and inclusive workplace. Initiatives like health and wellbeing programs, flexible work arrangements, and career development opportunities have made it an employer of choice in the region.  The Port of Newcastle s GRESB score reflects its target-driven ESG strategy, with a commitment to achieving Net Zero by 2040. The company plans to undertake GRESB benchmarking annually to track its progress and ensure continuous improvement in sustainability performance."/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://green-washer.com/greenwashing/2024-10-04/port-of-newcastle-improves-global-gresb-sustainability-rating-scores-100-on-climate-change-risk-identification/">
