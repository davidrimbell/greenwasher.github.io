  <meta name="title" content="Budget 2025 : Expand income tax incentives to boost high - end tourism , says hotels association Swak chairman"/>
  <meta name="description" content=" Malaysian Association of Hotels (MAH) Sarawak Chapter Chairman John Teo advocates for extending the income tax exemption currently granted to one to three-star hotels with Pioneer Status to four and five-star hotels. This move, he believes, will attract high-end tourists, increase national revenue, and promote sustainable practices, digital innovation, and workforce development.  Teo emphasizes the need for a comprehensive and tax-efficient strategy to benefit Malaysia s tourism sector and position the country as a leading global destination. He suggests that applying the same incentives to higher-end hotels will encourage investment in sustainable and competitive practices.  In addition to the tax exemption, Teo and his association members have been pushing for more tailored incentives, accelerated capital allowances, and tax reliefs for tourism industry players. These issues have been consistently raised in discussions and town hall meetings with relevant ministries since 2021.  Furthermore, MAH has called for green incentives, grants, or tax relief for hotels that meet the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) certification criteria. This aligns with the Ministry of Tourism, Arts, and Culture s National Tourism Policy 2030, which promotes sustainable practices in the tourism industry.  Regarding the hotel check-in and check-out time policy, Teo states that the issue of some hotels implementing a check-in time of 4pm and a check-out time of 11am is not a major concern in Sarawak. Hotel managements in the region are reportedly flexible, which helps mitigate any potential inconvenience for guests.  Overall, Teo s suggestions aim to enhance Malaysia s tourism sector by providing tax incentives, promoting sustainable practices, and encouraging investment in the industry. These measures are expected to attract high-end tourists, increase national revenue, and contribute to a sustainable and competitive economy."/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://green-washer.com/greenwashing/2024-10-04/budget-2025-expand-income-tax-incentives-to-boost-high-end-tourism-says-hotels-association-swak-chairman/">
