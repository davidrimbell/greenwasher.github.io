  <meta name="description" content="Greenwashing is when companies pretend to be more eco-friendly than they really are. They trick people with fake ads to attract those who care about the environment.
Companies lie about how good their products are for the environment. They use unclear words like &ldquo;natural&rdquo; or &ldquo;eco-friendly&rdquo; and only focus on one small part of their business that seems sustainable.
Some companies say they are &ldquo;carbon neutral&rdquo; but don&rsquo;t talk about their overall impact on the environment. They use green pictures in their ads but don&rsquo;t actually do much to reduce their carbon footprint.
Consumers need to know about greenwashing so they can make smart choices when buying things. They should make sure companies are honest about their environmental claims.
When people can spot fake claims about sustainability, they can support companies that truly care about the environment. This helps them avoid being tricked by false ads.
Public opinion can push companies to be more open and honest about their efforts to be sustainable. Companies like Teva Pharmaceuticals and NOVONIX show that businesses can commit to environmental and social goals to earn trust from customers.
To stop greenwashing, everyone – companies, regulators, and consumers – must work together. By being honest, accountable, and truly focused on sustainability, we can make a better future for the environment.
