    <p>When Dr. Hazel Berrard Amuah was appointed CEO of Prudential Life Ghana (PLI), he spoke to the public about the importance of plastic pollution and the impact of climate change. The BBC s Jonathan Head looks at what happened when he was founded as a leading environmental activist in the last two decades.
