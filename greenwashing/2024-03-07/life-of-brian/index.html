() What is there to describe the man who has been appointed to serve as an economist in charge of economic policies that strengthen the countrys industrial capacity and how the world is going to take advantage of global warming and greenhouse gas emissions, according to the New York Times, and who is the best man in making his fortunes and helping to save the planet?
