But  How would the bill be introduced in his first state address in 2024 - and how will it affect US businesses and firms, according to one of its chief executives and business leaders, and what will be the latest proposals to go on to raise the tax on stock buybacks and expanding the child tax credit? The BBC s Panorama looks at what they want to hear from analysts who are trying to find out when he is set to deliver the State of The Union address this week, the BBC has been asked to talk about some of his priorities for this year?
