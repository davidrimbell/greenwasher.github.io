  <meta name="description" content="Greenwashing is when companies try to look eco-friendly, but they&rsquo;re not. They use false claims to trick consumers. They may use unclear language or pictures to seem green.
One trick is using labels that make a product seem eco-friendly without proof. For example, &ldquo;natural&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t always mean good for the environment.
Companies might talk about small green things to hide bigger problems. They make it seem like they care about the environment when they really don&rsquo;t.
Some companies say their products are green without proof. For example, a product may be labeled biodegradable but still pollute the environment.
Consumers need to watch out for greenwashing to support truly green companies. Look for proof, transparency, and certifications to know if a company is really eco-friendly.
Greenwashing can make people not trust companies or real green efforts. The Volkswagen scandal is an example of this. They lied about their cars being green and got in trouble.
Consumers should be careful to support real green companies and make sure companies are honest about their environmental efforts. Transparency and honesty are key to a greener future.
