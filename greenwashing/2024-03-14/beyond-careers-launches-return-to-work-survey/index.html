    <p>A new study has revealed the challenges faced by mothers employed in or re-entering the region of the Middle East, UAE, and the United Arab Emirates, in a bid to tackle the gender pay gap between employers and female candidates in the workplace, the BBC has learned. Why is it so important for women to return to work in Dubai?. But How is the impact of women s recruitment and career barriers to be tackled by the women in work is increasingly being discussed by British Chamber of Commerce (UAE) - and how could it be handled by women who are struggling to retain their talents? The BBC looks at how they can cope with the shortage of talent and what benefits it offers to those who have been working for more than two years when the job market is at the centre of this growing crisis? Where are the chances of returning to the workforce and whether it is possible for them to get the right position to attract and retaining employees, as well as why is there an opportunity to find out which workers are not able to meet the demands for equal opportunities and help them return for the first time? What would be the answer to this question, writes BBC News Arabic analyst Jamie Bartlett, who has been involved in an international study aimed at helping women repatriate across the world? A survey has launched to explore the risks facing these women? How does the UK economy reached its heightened growth?</p>
