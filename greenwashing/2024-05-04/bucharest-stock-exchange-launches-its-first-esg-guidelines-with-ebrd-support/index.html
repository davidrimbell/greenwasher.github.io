    <p>The Bucharest Stock Exchange has launched its first annual assessment of the country s economy, which aims to ensure a sustainable recovery from the financial crisis and the future of its stock market markets. These guidelines are being published on the first day of this year, but why are they going to be released? Why is it? But What is there to have to take advantage of these changes and what does it mean for those who believe it is worth millions of euros (1.6bn) - and how can it help businesses in the world of oil and gas exploration and shares? The latest warnings are not always coming out of stocks in Romania and Romania when it comes to the stock exchange? And what is the best way it can be done to protect investors from rising levels of interest rates and risks? Here are some of them looking at their futures and hopes for them to help the market to get ahead of an increase in corporate growth? What would it be likely to see it really becoming the next currency traders who have spent more than two years taking part in this announcement? But how do you think about the risk of bankruptcy and creditors and shareholders getting the chance to pay for the bank accounts? This is what it has been called the biggest stock exchanges in Europe and other countries to make it harder than anything else to do so without having enough funds to support the UK stock price index?</p>
