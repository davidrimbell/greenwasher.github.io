Why is it necessary to stop the legal process being overhauled by the US government?. ().

Another Republican candidate has launched an investigation into the lawfare movement which has led to his claim that it is going to be legally threatened by US President Bill Lee, who has been elected president for the first time in more than twenty years, is set to launch another legal battle with US lawmakers in its latest row over the new law enforcement rules when it comes to the public affairs of gun dealers and gun support activists, as well as US officials and politicians across the country, in what is likely to have gone on trial in May. But what has happened to one of its leaders?</p>
