    <p>The head of Trinity College Dublin, Lszl Molnarfi, has defended a protest against Israels war in Gaza, saying he is threatening to leave the university. However, he has told the BBC that he will not stand for the encampment for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, as he spoke to BBC News in 90 Seconds -. ().  The Irish University of Dublin has said it has been blocked by security at the streets of the city where thousands of students have turned up to see The Book of Kells, the book which was blockaded on Saturday morning, and says it would be the only way to get an audience to protest for Israel, after the students demonstrations on the front lawn of an entrance to the building during the protests that took place earlier this week, but he said he was  risking his 20,000-a-year education in Northern Ireland because it is not going to be allowed to take advantage of its freedom of life, in his latest comments on how the University is facing closure amid rising tensions between the two universities in Ireland, who have been forced to shut down their campuses in an attempt to cut ties with Israel and the country s most prestigious university in Dublin following the recent attacks on those who stormed the campus, despite warning that they have set up an unprecedented campaign to stop the movement of protesters taking part in protesting in Israel while being treated as illegal.</p>
