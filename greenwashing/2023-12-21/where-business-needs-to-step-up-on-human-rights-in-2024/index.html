    <p>Corporate leaders are being asked to focus attention on human rights in the coming weeks, as the European Union begins to introduce new laws to protect their freedoms and the environment. But what are the key issues behind the EUs latest corporate policies? The BBC s Chris Stokel-Walker looks at a growing number of reports. ().

And what is that threat to help them protect the lives of people?</p>
