  <meta name="description" content="Greenwashing is when companies make their products seem more eco-friendly than they really are. This can trick people into buying things that aren&rsquo;t as good for the environment as they seem.
One way companies do this is by saying electric cars are better for the environment without mentioning that the power plants they use might still pollute. Electric cars are cleaner than regular cars, but it will take time for them to make a big difference in reducing emissions.
Some airlines are also guilty of greenwashing by charging extra for carbon offsetting or promoting sustainable fuel without proof it helps. The European Commission and the EU are working to stop these misleading practices and make companies be more honest about their sustainability efforts.
Changes at the Securities and Exchange Commission could affect how companies report on their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices. This raises concerns about the need for clear rules to stop greenwashing and ensure responsible investing.
Some government choices, like allowing oil drilling near wind farms, can put fossil fuels ahead of renewable energy. This makes it hard to balance energy needs with climate goals and shows why informed decisions are important.
Climate change can bring big risks to real estate, so it&rsquo;s important to take action and be aware of the impact of greenwashing. People should know how to spot greenwashing so they can support real environmental progress and sustainability.
To truly help the environment, we need to be open, accountable, and make smart choices. Fighting greenwashing is key to making real progress in sustainability in all industries.
