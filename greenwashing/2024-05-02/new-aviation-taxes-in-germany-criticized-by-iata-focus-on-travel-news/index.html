    <p>Germanys aviation industry is facing a  political madness  after the government announced it would increase the passenger tax on jet fuels, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA) chief executive, Martin Schulz, who has been involved in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. The airline industry has warned that this could harm the country. But How does it affect the German economy and its ability to become more environmentally friendly, it is being called the  unhealthy obsession  with the recent rise in aircraft taxes in Germany, and is likely to be damaged by the impact of the new tax hike in Europe and Europe, as part of efforts to decarbonise the air transport industry, the industry needs to take action to improve their competitiveness and promote climate change, but says it has failed to make it harder for the company to invest in de carbonisation and carbon emissions. Why is it so dangerous for German air traffic, writes the BBC s Michael Schumacher. Here is what experts have told us about the move. But what is the result of this move, with warnings that it will threaten German economic performance, not because it cannot be seen as an unhealthy shift in its business and the way it deals with other European nations to boost its performance? Should it be scrapped by higher revenues from the European taxation tariffs and risks to slow down growth, say analysts in German media, BBC News Arabic looks at how they are concerned.</p>
