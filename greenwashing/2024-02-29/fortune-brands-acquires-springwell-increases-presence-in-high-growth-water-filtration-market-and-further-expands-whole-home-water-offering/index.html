    <p>A US company has announced it has bought a water filtration system for $92m (88m). Fortune Brands innovators believe it is buying the companys entire portfolio of water products, including Do-It-Together and House of Rohl, Aqualisa, Ema, Moen and Airbus. They are among the companies behind the fortune. But  The BBC Newsnight looks at what it says is the first acquisition of an innovative water company in the US residential market - and what could be the result of the purchase of another giant water management company, Springwell Water Filtration Systems (PSW), which has been owned by Forbes Holdings, Inc., to become the world s second biggest buyers. The company is to buy the water filter system worth $9.2bn, or $91m in annual profits of $22m, and will increase revenue streams for businesses across the UK and the United States, as part of its expansion in global water quality growth in 2020, but is now expected to be linked to the sale of spring-based water systems designed to help improve homes and improve the quality of life in US homes, in an attempt to boost the global supply of smart, safer and more beautiful homes within their growing portfolio, with an investment of up to $4 billion each. But what is it likely to create opportunities for the firm to expand its water ecosystem based on smart household products and services being created by smarter, more connected products.</p>
