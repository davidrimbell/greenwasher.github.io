    <p>Barrons has released a list of top 100 US companies for their achievements in sustainability, environmental and social responsibility, in the latest annual list published by the US business magazine. They have been named as one of the 100 most sustainable businesses in Latin America, and each of those is among the top 10 companies in Mexico. () But What is the BBC s weekly The Boss series looks at the key challenges to the business sector across the world - and what is it likely to be the biggest winners of this year. The list has been unveiled in New York on Wednesday. A row between Ashley furniture maker Williams-Sonoma Inc. and Ethan Allen have become the first US company to make the list, as the country is celebrating the success of home furnishings industry in its effort to tackle climate change, social and governance efforts in US manufacturing. But what does this mean for the company? Why is this really going to happen? And why are they proudly recognised as being added to this list? The BBC has learned about the impact of socially responsible management and the commitment to help them achieve these goals? What makes them worth millions of lives in America? and how could it be able to achieve them? Among the 10 leading companies behind the new list is what it says is about to celebrate when it comes to home furniture, furniture and clothing industry, but what are taking place in this category? It is an opportunity to recognise them.</p>
