    <p> The Aerospace Conference in New Zealand has sparked controversy due to its connections with the US weapons industry and military, raising concerns about the weaponization of space. Peace Action Wellington criticized the conference, while Defence Minister Judith Collins announced New Zealand s participation in Operation Olympic Defender, a US-led initiative to counter threats in space.  Protestors called for Rocket Lab and Rakon to sever ties with military and surveillance partners, with some alleging their involvement in the  genocide  in Gaza through surveillance satellites. However, conference organizers defended aerospace technologies, citing their utility in various sectors, including climate change and illegal fishing.  Local venture capital firms are hesitant to invest in aerospace startups with potential military applications, as most have received backing from NZ Growth Capital Partners, which opposes dual-use technology investments. Syos Aerospace, a startup specializing in heavy-lifting helicopter drones, struggled to secure funding from New Zealand VCs due to this stance.  Rakon, a company that turns quartz crystals into radio frequency control systems, has experienced growth in its space and defense segment. The company emphasizes that its products are not designed for weapons and comply with New Zealand government regulations.  Rocket Lab, another aerospace company, has received significant contracts and grants from the US military but maintains that it only supports research rather than operational defense technology. The company s stance on dual-use technology has been a point of contention among protestors and critics.  In summary, the Aerospace Conference in New Zealand has highlighted the tension between the potential military applications of aerospace technologies and their broader utility in various sectors. Local venture capital firms  aversion to investing in dual-use technologies has further complicated the industry s growth, while companies like Rakon and Rocket Lab navigate these challenges while adhering to government regulations.</p>
