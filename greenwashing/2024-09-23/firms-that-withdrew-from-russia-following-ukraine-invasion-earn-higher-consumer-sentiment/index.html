    <p> The invasion of Ukraine by Russia in 2022 led to many companies, such as Dell and McDonald s, withdrawing or reducing their operations in Russia. This corporate response is seen as an example of stakeholder capitalism, where companies consider the interests of various stakeholders, including the environment and society, rather than solely focusing on shareholders. New research from the University of Notre Dame, led by Shankar Ganesan, examines the impact of these actions on consumer mindset metrics.  The study found that companies that withdrew from Russia experienced a significant increase in net brand buzz, indicating positive consumer sentiment. This effect was even stronger for companies with a strong environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reputation. These firms also saw enhanced brand consideration and purchase intent, suggesting that a strong ESG profile can amplify the benefits of socially responsible actions during geopolitical crises.  The research also highlighted the importance of timing in corporate decisions. Companies that delayed their withdrawal until after their industry peers saw a greater boost in net buzz, indicating that early action is valued but strategic timing can also be advantageous. Additionally, the study found variations in consumer reactions based on whether a company operates in a business-to-business (B2B) or business-to-consumer (B2C) context.  The study s findings contribute to understanding the relationship between corporate actions and consumer mindset metrics in a geopolitical context. It provides valuable insights for managerial decision-making and public policy, emphasizing the need for companies to consider the diverse interests of stakeholders, invest in ESG as a form of reputational insurance, carefully time major decisions, monitor consumer metrics, and tailor strategies to industry context.  In conclusion, the research suggests that companies operating in politically sensitive regions should account for the interests of various stakeholders, invest in ESG, carefully time major decisions, monitor consumer metrics, and tailor strategies to industry context. This approach can help businesses navigate geopolitical crises more effectively, balancing ethical imperatives with business objectives.</p>
