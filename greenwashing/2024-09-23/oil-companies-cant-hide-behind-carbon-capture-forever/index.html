    <p> Major oil companies have long engaged with climate activists, endorsing green initiatives and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) scores. However, this approach has been criticized as a miscalculation and betrayal, with industry players investing heavily in Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage (CCUS) technology. Despite the potential of CCUS, skepticism remains, and there are concerns about its viability at scale and the availability of permanent storage space.  The push for CCUS has led to significant investments, but the energy lost in operating carbon capture systems on power plants is substantial, raising concerns about the economic viability of such technologies. Moreover, environmentalists and government officials are increasingly opposed to fossil fuel energy, regardless of its efficiency or cleanliness.  The natural gas industry has also been criticized for lobbying against coal companies, despite advancements in emission regulations and CCUS technology. This has led to a perception that the natural gas industry is targeting coal companies, with the ultimate goal of pushing them out of the market.  The Biden administration s actions, such as hindering LNG export applications, have further fueled concerns about the future of the fossil fuel industry. Despite some energy companies fighting against radical environmentalists and anti-human activists, the overall sentiment suggests that the industry s survival is uncertain.  In conclusion, major oil, gas, and coal companies face significant challenges in the current climate landscape. While some companies are actively resisting environmentalist pressures, the broader industry is under threat from a combination of technological skepticism, regulatory opposition, and public sentiment. The future of these industries remains uncertain, as they navigate the complexities of decarbonization and environmental activism.</p>
