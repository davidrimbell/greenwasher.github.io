    <p> The Mintel report highlights air quality as the second biggest concern for consumers in the United States, with significant implications for manufacturing and distribution emissions. The report suggests that consumers are increasingly interested in claims about reduced packaging weight to lower distribution emissions. Richard Cope, a senior trends consultant at Mintel, emphasizes the importance of sustainable products that also meet health and dietary demands.  Despite growing awareness of environmental issues, the proportion of vegetarians, vegans, or pescatarians has plateaued, with meat and dairy consumption remaining entrenched. Consumers are also adopting self-preservation behaviors, such as conserving resources like food and water, in response to the impacts of climate change.  Approximately 34% of global consumers are concerned about air quality, with plastic pollution and water conservation also being significant concerns. However, consumers prioritize packaging performance over environmental credentials, and there is a growing skepticism towards companies  honesty about their environmental impact.  The Advertising Standards Authority s crackdown on misleading sustainability claims has led to changes in how companies approach their messaging. Eco-activists are becoming key educators on environmental issues, and a significant portion of consumers distrust companies  claims.  To address these concerns, consumers are interested in a Nutri-Score-style rating system for sustainability claims, which would provide a clear and convenient way to identify responsible companies. Ultimately, consumers want to know that they are supporting responsible brands without having to think about sustainability themselves.</p>
