    <p>Olympus has been awarded a permanent product award to the Michener Institute of Education (UHN) in the US for its surgical education and simulation programme, reports the BBC s weekly The Conversation on the latest announcements from the industry. Why is this award worth millions of dollars? Should it be given the chance to become successful. But What is among those awarding their achievements? The BBC has learned about what could be the best way to improve educational opportunities for patients and the way the world is prepared to develop advanced medical procedures and how they are being treated in an effort to tackle the coronavirus pandemic, and what is it like to help them increase the number of patients who are at risk of dying from infections in hospitals and other areas of the UK, in which it is set to be used to provide emergency medical equipment to train patients, asks the University of New York. Here is the full list of 10 pioneering equipment - including 10GI towers and an in-kind award for the first time in more than two decades, but why does it really help developing further lessons for healthcare professionals? And how it can operate when it comes to an endoskopic surgery programme across the United States, with an award that aims to bring in specialist experts to work on innovative ways to treat patients during the Covid-19 lockdown restrictions, as well as where scientists have been able to teach hundreds of people?</p>
