    <p>A US company which provides good working environments for women has been named the best employer for female employees in the US Labor Force. However, the company has failed to achieve a significant improvement in its performance, according to reports from the corporation s chief executive Deb Butters, who says it is committed to boosting diversity and growth. (). US business giant Orbia has received an awards for its annual list of best companies for Women and Millennials in 2024, and is marking the first time it has made progress in improving the performance of women in work-life balance, social and governance policies, as part of an ambitious effort to improve the quality of leadership roles for the women and millennial workers. The company is to be given the status of one of the worlds most valuable business in US manufacturing, but is now making progress on the top of its lists of companies that provide excellent working conditions for woman and young people, with the aim of helping women to grow and improve their ability to serve as managers and directors. But what does this mean for companies offering good work environment for men and women? Why is it likely to have been recognised by the Womens Choice Award? The BBC News looks at what it hopes to bring it to the number of people who have taken part in this year. Here is the full assessment of how they work for more than half of all those who are working for male-dominated industries and how it makes it more efficiently.</p>
