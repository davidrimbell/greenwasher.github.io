    <p>A growing anti-woke movement in the US is being turned on its head by a group of right-wing activists. But what does it mean for those who are sensitive and involved in their struggle against social injustice? The BBC s Christine Blasey looks at how the word is used to describe the progressive causes,. () What is the term really often associated with political violence, and what is it actually going to be when it comes to human rights and how it is described by some members of the right, which is now increasingly spreading to the left? Why is this coming into force? And why has it been taken into effect by the ultra-conservatives? What could it be used as an insult? Is it not enough to refer to people who have gone on the campaign to tackle social justice, writes Paul McCartney, who has told the BBC, is that they are still struggling to find out what it has happened in recent years. The latest debate is about the use of these words in US politics, as well as the way it can be dealt with the idea of racism, gender equality or climate change? It is not the most commonly used word in America. What has the meaning of wokeness in some areas of America, but what has been used for the first time in more than two decades, with an increase in criticism of some of its opposition parties, in particular among the mainly conservative groups?</p>
