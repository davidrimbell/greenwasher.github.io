    <p>It s almost impossible to forget that the Republicans are taking part in the US presidential election. But what happened when it comes to voting in Iowa, Florida, and why is it likely to be the worst political debate in history? Why is the Trump team struggling to make it out of first place? What is going to?  But How is Donald Trump losing the battle to get out to the polls and how is he preparing to win the election - and what does it mean for him? And could he be able to take another victory in this weeks election? It is not always the most important thing to do with his team, which looks like he might have been making it up close to one of the top votes in their primary election campaign? The BBC spoke to Joe Biden to find out what is happening for the first time in two weeks of his campaign, writes Michael Madden, who has spent the last few days in his leadership. What makes it harder for those who remain behind these predictions, or would they become the biggest winners in US history, is that he is still being animated and who is on the front line? But how do you really know that it is possible to stop it coming to an end to his party, as everybody tells us how he will be prepared to vote on Wednesday? A row between the two candidates across the United States, the BBC has learned.</p>
