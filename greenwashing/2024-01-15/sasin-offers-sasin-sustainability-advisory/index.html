    <p>The worlds biggest companies are pushing ahead with sustainability efforts in Thailand and Southeast Asia. The BBC s Jonathan Head looks at the challenges facing business leaders in developing sustainable businesses, including climate change, and the impact of environmental changes on their corporate growth. This week we speak to Sasin School of Management, who is the BBC. But How is it possible to take a look at how the world is going to be able to tackle the global warming crisis and whether they are taking steps to ensure the environment remains safe and safe, but what does it mean for those who want to make renewable investments and invest in companies that have the same benefits as the US, China, Russia and China? They are trying to change the way the country is prepared to achieve net zero - and how it can be done to help them achieve these targets? Here are some of the key takeaways from the industry. Why is this shift increasingly being driven by the coronavirus pandemic and its impact on consumers and business markets? What could it be likely to get us to see when it comes to social and environment issues, as well as why it is important for companies in the UK and South Asia, to find out what is happening and what it means for the future of its economy and future generations. Here is what happens in this week. So what are we looking at which companies have become the most successful business in recent years? The latest findings have been released.</p>
