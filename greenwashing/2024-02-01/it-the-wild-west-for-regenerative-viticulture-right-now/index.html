    <p>The growing number of wine producers using the term regenerative to refer to a bunch of practices is increasingly concerned about the threat of damage being caused by the practice, according to one of the worlds most famous wine labels, Bonterra Organic Estates, who has said it could become the Wild West for regenerative. (). Why is it so often referred to as renewable - and why does the word be used without an adequate standardised definition or rules? The BBC has been talking to the producer Jess Baum, the director of Bon terra  organicestates in California, saying they are struggling to identify their claims to be revived, but experts have told the BBC that it is not essentially an adjectif that would be devalued because of an absence of legal definitions for which it can be claimed, and the way it has gone on to take place when it comes to regeneration, as well as its chief executive, James Baum has warned that there is no evidence that some of them can use it instead of recognising those who believe it may be the best way to tackle the risk of devaluation, after warnings about rising numbers of firms that are trying to stop the use of this term having no substance behind it, in the wake of recent attacks on the wine industry following the coronavirus pandemic and its impact on consumers. But what is the reason for the trend to make it harder?</p>
