    <p>Sodexo shares have been booked to the liquidity account as part of the annual general meeting of shareholders. The latest report on the future of their financial affairs has been published by the French regulator, AMF, in a summary of what happened during the second half of this year. These are the details of how the firm has moved to leave. But Here is the BBC s Christine Lagarde explains how it is going to sell its assets to BNP Paribas and why it was suspended after the start of its liquidation contract - which could be extended until the end of next year, and what remains in the public account of so-called  the Asset Management Group  (AMF) following the decision to suspend the stock market for the first time in more than two decades. This is what is about to be learned about how to buy these assets, as well as where they are being listed. So when the company is to close the market, how is it worth millions of euros (27m) and how much it can be done to make it more profitable than previously agreed to take over the last year amid the coronavirus pandemic, but how does this mean for those who have spent the past two weeks of trading in France. Here are five steps to find out what was taken from the current liquidite contract, with the release of an interim report from February 1 2024. What is so far known as the  Sodekso  announcements about its future growth and future.</p>
