    <p>Women leaders in India are being encouraged to create a culture of courage and sisterhood, according to the BBC s annual #GullyChat. Why are women leaders driving diversity and equality for business success and how do they contribute to their success? Should women be able to help them achieve equal rights? And why is it important? How is female leadership really important for businesses to achieve success, asks Adgully, the chief executive of the Indian company, AVP Madhurima Bhatia, who has become the first leading businessman in the world to make the same way as those who claim to be the most successful women in corporate culture? What are the key factors that are needed to tackle the issues of gender equality, and what does it mean for the business? The BBC looks at what happens to women leader, as she explains what is needed for women to develop inclusive behaviours, writes Geeta Pandey on the issue of #Gully Chat - which has been released by the company.

Here are some of its key takeaways from the industry?</p>
