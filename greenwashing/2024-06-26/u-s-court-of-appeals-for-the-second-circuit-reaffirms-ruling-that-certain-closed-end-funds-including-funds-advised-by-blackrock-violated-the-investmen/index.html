S . Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit Reaffirms Ruling That Certain Closed - End Funds , Including Funds Advised by BlackRock , Violated the Investment Company Act of 1940</a>
    <p>The US Court of Appeals for the Southern District of New York has rejected a lawsuit against 11 private funds that have illegally stripped shareholders of their shares in an election election, which could lead to billions of US dollars in losses and damages to businesses and business leaders across the country, the US media report.. (). But One of the 11 Funds have won an appeal to stop the practice of voting stripping shareholder’s rights to vote in elections. The Supreme Court has ruled that 11 of them have been found guilty of violating the Investment Company Act, in the first case of an investigation by the company, Saba Capital Management, L.P., over the use of control share provisions in order to protect closed-end investors who lost millions of dollar in US taxpayers, who have suffered more than $200bn (£27bн) in lost money. Why is it going to be able to win another legal challenge to US lawsuits? The BBC understands what happened to 11 financial firms that were found to have violated the investment company laws, and how they are being involved in legal action to prevent them from taking part in election campaigns, after the High Court ordered the decision to put an end to the legal process of presidential election - including the BlackRock, Royce Global Value Trust and other offshore investments firm Saba, has won the battle to overturn the way the firm is operating during the 2016 US election. But what is the case?</p>
