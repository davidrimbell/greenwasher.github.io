      <description>British designer Stella McCartney expressed her concern over the  billions of birds  killed for the fashion industry during her Paris show, which she titled  It s about&amp;hellip; time.  The event, held near the Eiffel Tower, showcased sustainable fashion pieces made from unconventional materials like lentils and mushroom leather. McCartney, daughter of ex-Beatle Paul McCartney and animal rights activist Linda McCartney, is an advisor to luxury tycoon Bernard Arnault on sustainability.  Bird motifs were prominent in her spring-summer collection, where she combined her signature business suits and jackets with delicate blouses and dresses. McCartney aimed to balance the  masculinity  of some cuts with a  lightness of touch  and  femininity in flight.  She also highlighted her use of  apple leather  made from waste in the apple industry and metallic bras shaped like birds.  The designer, a lifelong vegetarian, has long advocated for sustainability in fashion, with her brand praised for its innovation and transparency. The fashion industry, however, faces criticism for its environmental impact, with some brands accused of greenwashing.  The show was attended by Hollywood figures such as Greta Gerwig, Natalie Portman, and Hayley Williams. The event also saw protests at Hermes Paris Fashion Week, where the luxury house is known for its leather goods. Despite this, McCartney s commitment to sustainable fashion remains a significant influence in the industry.</description>

      <description>In today&amp;rsquo;s world, more people care about the environment. But some companies pretend to be eco-friendly to trick consumers, investors, and the public. This is called &amp;ldquo;greenwashing.&amp;rdquo; They hide bad practices behind a fake green image. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at some recent examples to understand this better.
A big company recently said it aims to have Net Zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, with smaller goals by 2030. This sounds good, but there&amp;rsquo;s more to the story.</description>

      <description>The candidates for Pennsylvania Treasurer in the 2024 general election have outlined their visions for improving the State Treasurer s office and increasing transparency. Erin McClelland (Democrat) proposes expanding the database of state contracts to include vendor demographics and compliance with US trade policies. She also suggests reinstating pension investment standards and increasing transparency by acknowledging errors and incorporating ESG ratings.  Stacy Garrity (Republican) emphasizes building on her achievements, such as returning unclaimed property and earning a Gold Rating for the PA 529 College &amp;amp; Career Program. She plans to continue cutting fees for savings programs and improve transparency by adding new features to the Transparency Portal and revamping the Fiscal Health Scorecard.  Nickolas Ciesielski (Libertarian) focuses on reducing state debt and eliminating state pensions, proposing a shift to a 457 retirement plan and including Bitcoin in state investment funds. He advocates for a more detailed breakdown of investment pools and a crowdsourced auditing system.  Troy Bowman (Constitution County, Allegheny) and Chris Foster (Forward County, Allegheny) have not provided specific proposals. However, Bowman emphasizes serving all Pennsylvanians and enhancing transparency, while Foster highlights fiscal responsibility and collaboration for a secure financial future.  Overall, the candidates aim to increase transparency, accountability, and fiscal responsibility in the State Treasurer s office, with varying approaches to addressing state debt, investment policies, and public access to information.</description>

However, these statements are not guarantees of future results or performance and involve various risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict and often beyond the company s control.

      <title>Big U . S . oil companies reveal massive payments to foreign governments</title>

      <description>The three largest U.S. energy companies, Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., and ConocoPhillips, disclosed payments to foreign governments totaling over US$42 billion in 2023, which is approximately eight times more than what they paid domestically. This disclosure, mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), was a result of a decade-long push by transparency advocates to shed light on the foreign financial transactions of Big Oil in its global pursuit for oil.  The United States has become the world s largest oil and gas producer, largely due to the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico. However, the disclosures reveal that about 90% of Exxon s global payments went to foreign governments, despite nearly a quarter of its global exploration and production earnings coming from the U.S. The company paid out US$22.5 billion in taxes, royalties, and other items overseas, with the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, and Malaysia being the top recipients.  In contrast, Exxon made about US$2.3 billion in U.S.-based payments in 2023, including just US$1.2 billion to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Exxon s U.S.-based upstream earnings totaled US$4.2 billion, compared to US$17.1 billion in non-U.S. markets.  Chevron paid US$14.6 billion to foreign governments in 2023, with Australia alone receiving US$4 billion. The company paid just US$2 billion in the U.S. Chevron executives see the low or no royalty payments in the Permian Basin as a significant advantage, creating shareholder value.  ConocoPhillips disclosed that just US$1.3 billion of its total US$6.5 billion in global payments went to the U.S.  The disclosures were made possible by Section 1504 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which was adopted by the SEC in 2020 after a long battle involving a federal</description>

      <description>The three largest U.S. energy exploration companies, Exxon Mobil, Chevron Corp, and ConocoPhillips, paid over $42 billion to foreign governments in the previous year, which is roughly eight times more than their payments within the United States. This information was disclosed for the first time due to a new SEC requirement, which transparency advocates have been pushing for over a decade. The aim is to shed light on Big Oil s foreign financial transactions and assess whether U.S. taxpayers receive a fair share of the value from the U.S. s surge in oil and gas production.  In 2023, about 90% of Exxon s global payments, totaling nearly $25 billion, were made to foreign governments, despite nearly a quarter of its global exploration and production earnings coming from the U.S. The United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, and Malaysia were among the top recipients of Exxon s overseas payments. In contrast, Exxon made about $2.3 billion in U.S.-based payments, including $1.2 billion to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.  Chevron paid $14.6 billion to foreign governments, with $4 billion going to Australia alone. The company made just $2 billion in the U.S. Chevron executives view the low overhead in the U.S. as a significant advantage, particularly in the Permian Basin, where about 75% of the land has low or no royalty payments.  ConocoPhillips paid $1.3 billion of its $6.5 billion total global payments to the U.S.  The disclosures were made possible by Section 1504 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which was adopted by the SEC in 2020 after a long battle involving a federal court vacating the SEC s first attempt and Congress blocking a second attempt. The rule aims to increase transparency and accountability between governments and the energy industry, in response to the growing ESG movement.  Overall, the disclosures reveal a significant disparity in the distribution of payments between the U</description>

      <title>Namibia : Harnessing Hope - How Namibia Can Avoid the Traps of Oil Dependency</title>

      <description>Namibia s burgeoning oil and gas sector, with significant foreign investments from companies like Total Energies, Shell, and Galp, has sparked optimism for economic growth. However, this development raises concerns about the  Dutch disease,  where a booming natural resource sector overshadows other vital industries such as agriculture and tourism. Between 2021 and 2023, Namibia attracted N$73 billion in foreign direct investment, with 45% concentrated in oil and gas. While this may boost the economy in the short term, it risks neglecting traditional sectors crucial for sustainable development.  Agriculture, supporting 70% of Namibia s population and contributing 5.1% to GDP, and tourism, employing over 100,000 individuals and contributing 3.5% to GDP in 2018, could suffer from this imbalance. The minister of agriculture, water, and land reform, Calle Schlettwein, warned against the overemphasis on oil and gas, noting that environmental concerns are often overlooked. He highlighted the industrial development of green hydrogen in one of Namibia s national parks, funded by the Environmental Investment Fund.  The  Africa Rising  narrative, exemplified by Mozambique s natural gas discoveries, has led to optimism about economic growth and development. However, Mozambique s experience shows that this optimism can be dashed by declining commodity prices and ongoing conflict. Zimbabwe s Marange diamond discovery also failed to deliver on its promises due to corruption.  To avoid similar pitfalls, Namibia must focus on investing in its traditional sectors, ensuring a balanced and sustainable approach to development. This will help build a resilient and inclusive economy, avoiding the risks associated with overreliance on a single sector.</description>

      <description>Alabama state officials and First Solar have inaugurated a new factory in Lawrence County, marking a significant step in the state s renewable energy journey. The $1.1 billion facility, expected to double the state s solar jobs, will produce 3.5 gigawatts of solar capacity annually, contributing to the US renewable energy profile. Despite Alabama s red state politics and low ranking in solar capacity, the factory s establishment is a testament to the state s commitment to clean energy.  First Solar, a global leader in thin film solar technology, has chosen Alabama for its newest factory, citing factors such as land cost, transportation access, and state incentives. The company s cadmium telluride (CdTe) technology offers advantages over conventional silicon solar panels, including lower costs, greater efficiencies, and a smaller environmental footprint.  The project has faced opposition from anti-ESG legislation, which seeks to protect the fossil energy industry from competition. However, First Solar s  Responsible Solar  approach aligns with ESG principles, emphasizing the company s commitment to the planet, communities, and customers.  Despite the state s low ranking in solar capacity and the passage of anti-ESG legislation, Alabama s new factory demonstrates the state s potential to contribute to the US s renewable energy goals. The facility will provide solar developers with a significant supply of solar panels, supporting the interstate market and promoting sustainable energy solutions.</description>

      <description>The Texas Stock Exchange (TXSE) has announced the hiring of executives from Charles Schwab Corp., Nasdaq Inc., and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to build a leadership team ahead of its planned operations in the upcoming year. Cam Smith, a former SEC employee, will become the global head of trading, while Jeffrey Brown joins as general counsel and chief regulatory officer. Nicole Chambers from Nasdaq will serve a similar role for TXSE Group Inc.  The TXSE has raised $135 million and plans to file registration documents with the SEC soon. The exchange has the support of major investors like BlackRock Inc. and Citadel Securities. It aims to challenge the NYSE and Nasdaq in Texas  bid to attract more financial services industry jobs.  TXSE will be headquartered in Dallas, which has been gaining financial jobs from companies like Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Charles Schwab. The exchange will not require companies to meet any environmental, social, and governance (ESG) thresholds, aligning with the state s efforts to reduce burdensome regulations for businesses.  Marc Cunningham, former regional head of capital markets for the NYSE in Houston, will be the global managing director. Richard Fisher, former Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas president, will serve as a strategic adviser. Brett Redfearn, former SEC director, will also be a strategic adviser.  TXSE s board includes Tom Long, co-CEO of Energy Transfer LP, Paul Foster, founder of Western Refining Inc., Alex Bussandri, global head of strategy at Citadel Securities, Tyson Tuttle, former CEO of Silicon Labs, and former Texas Governor Rick Perry.  The TXSE s establishment is seen as apolitical, with the aim of providing a competitive alternative to the NYSE and Nasdaq. The exchange s all-electronic trading operations are set to begin next year, bolstering Dallas  growing financial industry.</description>

      <description>Ruth Yu-Owen, President and CEO of Upgrade Energy Philippines (UGEP), exemplifies resilience and visionary leadership in the renewable energy sector. Her journey began in Zamboanga City, where she sold candies as a young entrepreneur. Despite failing the Certified Public Accountant Licensure Exam, she pursued a career in sales, leading to senior positions in an international freight forwarding company. The loss of her job at its peak propelled her into the renewable energy industry, where she founded PhilCarbon in 2006.  In 2016, Ruth partnered with Belgian company Upgrade Energy to establish UGEP, focusing on rooftop solar projects for the commercial and industrial segment. The company offers comprehensive services, including engineering, procurement, construction, operations, maintenance, and project financing for renewable energy projects. Under Ruth s leadership, UGEP completed the Philippines  largest solar rooftop project for a major conglomerate in Batangas, with a capacity of 13,800 kilowatt-peak.  Despite facing challenges, such as opposition to a wind farm project in Sagada and missed opportunities for government incentives, Ruth invested her personal savings to keep her business afloat and prioritized her team s welfare. Her commitment to integrity, continuous learning, and ethical standards is evident in her active participation in governance programs and various committees and boards.  Ruth s influence extends to championing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles, establishing new benchmarks for sustainability in the energy sector. UGEP s employment practices reflect a 50-50 gender balance and a commitment to employee well-being, mirroring Ruth s belief in diversity, inclusiveness, and social responsibility.
