  <meta name="description" content=" The Taicang High-Tech Industrial Development Zone (THIDZ) in Jiangsu Province, China, was recently honored as the  Best ESG Community in Sino-European Economic and Trade Cooperation  at the Sino-European Corporate ESG Best Practices Conference in Frankfurt, Germany. Since its establishment in 1993, THIDZ has fostered sustainable development, corporate social responsibility, and governance mechanisms, with a focus on key components for new energy vehicles, machine tools, and aerospace industries.  Over the years, more than 500 German companies have invested in the zone, contributing to an annual industrial output of over RMB 60 billion. The zone has also emphasized green technology and environmental protection, with projects like the Sino-German Energy Efficiency Network, which has achieved significant results in energy efficiency and carbon emission reduction.  In addition to industrial collaboration, THIDZ has made significant strides in vocational education, implementing Germany s dual vocational education system since 2001. This system has become a hallmark of the zone s industrial development and talent cultivation.  The zone has also improved its business environment, introducing policies to support enterprise development. The recognition at the conference highlights the success of THIDZ as a model community for Sino-German cooperation, showcasing achievements in industrial collaboration, talent development, cultural integration, and green growth.
