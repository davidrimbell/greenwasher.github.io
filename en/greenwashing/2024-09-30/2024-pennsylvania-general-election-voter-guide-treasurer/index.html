  <meta name="description" content=" The candidates for Pennsylvania Treasurer in the 2024 general election have outlined their visions for improving the State Treasurer s office and increasing transparency. Erin McClelland (Democrat) proposes expanding the database of state contracts to include vendor demographics and compliance with US trade policies. She also suggests reinstating pension investment standards and increasing transparency by acknowledging errors and incorporating ESG ratings.  Stacy Garrity (Republican) emphasizes building on her achievements, such as returning unclaimed property and earning a Gold Rating for the PA 529 College &amp; Career Program. She plans to continue cutting fees for savings programs and improve transparency by adding new features to the Transparency Portal and revamping the Fiscal Health Scorecard.  Nickolas Ciesielski (Libertarian) focuses on reducing state debt and eliminating state pensions, proposing a shift to a 457 retirement plan and including Bitcoin in state investment funds. He advocates for a more detailed breakdown of investment pools and a crowdsourced auditing system.  Troy Bowman (Constitution County, Allegheny) and Chris Foster (Forward County, Allegheny) have not provided specific proposals. However, Bowman emphasizes serving all Pennsylvanians and enhancing transparency, while Foster highlights fiscal responsibility and collaboration for a secure financial future.  Overall, the candidates aim to increase transparency, accountability, and fiscal responsibility in the State Treasurer s office, with varying approaches to addressing state debt, investment policies, and public access to information."/><meta name="robots" content="index,follow"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://green-washer.com/en/greenwashing/2024-09-30/2024-pennsylvania-general-election-voter-guide-treasurer/">
