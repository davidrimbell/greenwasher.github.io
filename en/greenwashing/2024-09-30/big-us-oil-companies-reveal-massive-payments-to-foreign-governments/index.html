In 2023, about 90% of Exxon s global payments, totaling nearly $25 billion, were made to foreign governments, despite nearly a quarter of its global exploration and production earnings coming from the U.S. The United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, and Malaysia were among the top recipients of Exxon s overseas payments.
