  <meta name="description" content=" The document discusses the company s commitment to achieving Net Zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 in its financing activities, operations, and supply chain. It sets interim 2030 Net Zero emissions targets, including financed emissions targets and sustainable finance commitments. These targets may evolve over time due to proposed legislative and regulatory changes in multiple jurisdictions, which could significantly impact future measurement, reporting, and the effectiveness of the company s sustainability efforts.  The company uses forward-looking statements, such as  anticipates,   targets,  and  expects,  to express its current expectations, plans, or forecasts. However, these statements are not guarantees of future results or performance and involve various risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict and often beyond the company s control. Actual outcomes may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements due to factors like global socio-demographic and economic trends, energy prices, technological advances, climate-related conditions, legislative and regulatory changes, public policies, stakeholder engagement, data quality and availability, and the company s ability to implement sustainability initiatives.  The document also mentions that the content on referenced websites is not incorporated by reference into this document, and third-party website references and links do not imply an affiliation, sponsorship, or endorsement. The document was published on September 30, 2024, and contains Sustainability Information applicable to the company and its subsidiaries worldwide.  In summary, the company is committed to achieving Net Zero emissions by 2050, with interim targets set for 2030. However, the success of these efforts depends on various factors, including legislative changes, technological advancements, and the company s ability to implement sustainability initiatives.
